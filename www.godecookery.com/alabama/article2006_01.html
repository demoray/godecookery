Renaissance Roundtable get ready for the Renaissance Feast Saturday,
Oct. 21, at the Florence-Lauderdale Coliseum. Open to-anyone who buys a
ticket, the feast features Renaissance costumes and d&eacute;cor and an
authentic Viking-style menu. JIM HANNON/TimesDaily</span></small><br>

FLORENCE -- Queen Freya, Lady of Clan Greywolf, is inviting 200 of her
closest friends to a royal feast -- and that includes you. <br>
      <br>
As the monarch reigning over this year's Renaissance activities in the
Shoals, Queen Freya -- actually Ann Iaria, of Florence -- will preside
over the annual feast.<br>
      <br>
Open to anyone who buys a ticket, the feast features medieval
characters (in reality, members of the volunteer Renaissance
Roundtable) in full costume as well as entertainment, music and a
multi-course dinner. The coliseum will be decorated to resemble a
Viking hall.<br>
      <br>
It's a highlight of October as Renaissance Month, which culminates in
the Alabama Renaissance Faire, Friday--Saturday, Oct. 28-29, at Wilson
Park.<br>
      <br>
Iaria earned the right to rule when she found the coveted hidden coin
baked into a cake at the 2005 feast.<br>
      <br>
Each year at the feast, the finder of the coin is declared the new
ruler and crowned at the faire the next weekend. Anyone who wants to
try to find the coin has a chance of becoming the ruler.<br>
      <br>
Because of her Viking heritage and interest in Viking history, Iaria
called herself the "Viking Queen." The feast will continue that theme,
thanks to Renaissance chef Jim Matterer, of Newark, Del., who's catered
the dinner since 2001.<br>

Matterer, whose catering business is called Gode Cookery, prepares
Renaissance feasts throughout the eastern half of the country using
original historical recipes. The resulting meals are as close to
authentic as he can get.<br>
      <br>
But because he couldn't find any original documentation for Viking
cooking, he turned to 11th century Frisian food to recreate the
experience Iaria wanted.<br>
      <br>
The Frisians, related to the Saxons and Angles, lived in what's now
northern Germany. Their culture was similar to the Vikings'.<br>
      <br>
Dishes for the feast include onion soup, marinated cabbage salad, roast
chicken in wine broth, dilled carrots, roast beef in sauce, baked
apples and pears and an almond tart, along with bread and butter and
"Alabama Ale" and "Ren Wine" -- or sweet tea and lemon water. Several
of the dishes are vegetarian and vegan, as well.<br>
      <br>
In addition, Matterer hand-carved a mold of a Viking ship to make
Viking-theme cookies for the feast. His cookies every year are so
creative that many attending the feast save them as-souvenirs.<br>
      <br>
Matterer discovered Renaissance cooking when he volunteered 25 years
ago to cook for a meeting of the medieval-re-enactment group Society of
Creative Anachronism.<br>
      <br>
His hobby became a passion as more and more original documents on
medieval food became available for research. He taught himself how to
read and speak medieval English so he could decipher them.<br>
      <br>
"I choose recipes that I know will be familiar the way they are," he
said. "We don't serve restuffed calf brains or flaming peacock heads.<br>
      <br>
"I look at the recipes carefully and choose ones that aren't so unusual
that people won't understand or appreciate them. I want people to have
a good time and walk away satisfied."<br>
      <br>
      </span></font>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><font class="gen_art"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><big>As authentic as possible</big></span></font><br>
      <font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></font></div>
      <font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
He tried the Florence feast menu out a couple of weeks ago for a dinner
at the University of Delaware and got a good reaction, he said.<br>
      <br>
"There's nothing weird or strange or unrecognizable," he said. "We're
keeping as close to authentic as possible but still will be pleasing.
We have to cook for our audience, which is what medieval cooks did,
too."<br>
      <br>
Helping with the feast is Matterer's taster, Darrell McCormick, also of
Newark, Del., and Matterer's friend and assistant, Lisa Blair, of
Mobile, who brings a crew of helpers.<br>
      <br>
Lee Freeman, a longtime member of the Renaissance Roundtable, is the
one who originally contacted Matterer several years ago, to cater the
feast. He found the chef on the Internet.<br>
      <br>
"Our faire is about education, art, creativity and fun. An authentic
medieval feast served by pages and squires in traditional style with
everyone in their garb and medieval music and entertainment lets people
experience what medieval food and food etiquette at a feast was really
like," Freeman said.<br>
      <br>
"We could serve ordinary food, but part of the educational experience
is to sample authentic medieval cuisine. Where else in northwest
Alabama can you get quince in walnut pastries or chicken in verjuice?"<br>
      <br>
Even if you're not sure you'll like the food, give it a try, Freeman
said.<br>
      <br>
"I'm a very particular eater, and I love the food," he added. "As Jim
says on his Web site, medieval people knew what tasted good the same as
we do."<br>
      <br>
The names may look a bit strange to us in their medieval Italian,
English or French, but the food tastes great."<br>
      <br>
And those attending the feast may have a chance to meet the next Food
Network star.<br>
      <br>
Matterer has been featured on two segments of the network's "The Secret
Life Of &#8230;" show. He'll also be in a third about Halloween that airs
this month. The Food Network is on Comcast 60.<br>
      <br>
Matterer is submitting a proposal to the Food Network for his own show.<br>
