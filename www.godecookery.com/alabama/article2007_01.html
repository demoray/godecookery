      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">There's
no other evening like it in the Shoals.<br>
      <br>
The annual Alabama Renaissance Faire feast, Saturday, Oct. 20, in the
Florence-Lauderdale Coliseum, offers diners a true-to-life medieval
Italian feast.<br>
      <br>
Open to anyone with a ticket, the feast features authentic food,
costumes and entertainment.<br>
      <br>
It's part of a month of activities leading up to the Alabama
Renaissance Faire, Oct. 27-28, in Wilson Park in Florence.<br>
      <br>
"The whole idea of the feast is to have fun while at the same time
stepping back to the Middle Ages and Italian Renaissance," said Lee
Freeman, of Florence, a member of the Renaissance Roundtable group that
plans the feast and the fair. "Where else can people sample delicious
yet authentic medieval cuisine? Anyone that's expecting what you'd get
at a Medieval Times restaurant (a chain of medieval-style eateries) is
in for a pleasant surprise. Real medieval cuisine is much better!"<br>
      <br>
Jim Matterer, of Gode Cookery medieval catering in Newark, Del.,
created the menu and will prepare the food for the feast as he's done
for the past several years.<br>
      <br>
This year's theme is a royal autumn Italian feast with a strong Middle
Eastern influence.<br>
      <br>
"As a longtime member of the medieval reenactment group the Society for
Creative Anachronism, Jim researches, and in some cases actually
translates, recipes from authentic medieval and Renaissance cookbooks
for our feasts," Freeman said.<br>
      <br>
Diners at the feast are seated at tables and servers bring the food.
Feast organizers encourage guests to bring their own eating utensils
and table decorations.<br>
      <br>
"The Roundtable provides your standard paper plates, paper napkins and
plastic silverware, but if you want something more authentic and fun,
you should bring your own," Freeman said.<br>
      <br>
In fact, many feast-goers decorate their table spaces in elegant
Renaissance detail, but that's not necessary, he added.<br>
      <br>
"Historically speaking, 'less is better,' as medieval table settings
were spare and utilitarian, but a little showing-off is fun, too, and
many guests like to go all out," Freeman said. "If you're looking for
cheap, historical-looking table ware and accessories, visit flea
markets, yard sales and thrift stores. You'll be amazed at what you can
find there!"<br>
      <br>
The coliseum will be open Friday and Saturday, Oct. 19 and 20, for
decorating before the feast, he added.<br>
      <br>
In addition to the food, the evening features period entertainment.<br>
      <br>
"We have been quite busy this year," said Roundtable member Donna
Miles, of Florence, in charge of entertainment for the feast. "Planning
something new each year is a challenge. There are classic things which
everyone wants, but there needs to be something fresh, as well."<br>
      <br>
This year's schedule calls for dancing by the feast-goers, belly
dancing by the local group the Rainbow Dancers, a professional singer,
sword fighters, American tribal belly dancing by Lumani of Huntsville,
William of the Hood and an audience interactive skit.<br>
      <br>
Another part of the "entertainment" for those attending the feast is
the costuming: In keeping with the spirit of the evening, many guests
are in full Renaissance dress.<br>
      <br>
"If you enjoy elegant costumes, the feast is where you need to be,"
Miles said. "People really pull out all the stops. Gold and glitter,
regal doublets, shiny swords and beaming children. It truly feels like
we're at court."<br>
      <br>
But you don't have to wear Renaissance outfits to attend.<br>
      <br>
"Costumes are admired but not required," Freeman said, "although it's
more fun to dress up."<br>
      <br>
Need help creating a Renaissance outfit? The Roundtable sponsors a
costume-making workshop from<br>
      <br>
9 a.m. until 2 p.m. Saturday at the<br>
      <br>
Kennedy-Douglass Center for the Arts, 217 E. Tuscaloosa St., Florence.<br>
      <br>
"We use a single tunic pattern that's a unisex style," Miles said.
"Each person can decorate it up or leave it plain. Each tunic requires
your length twice, all one piece.<br>
      <br>
"The fabric should be at least 54-inches wide, although 60-inches is
better."<br>
      <br>
Wilson's Fabrics and Hancock Fabrics, both in Florence, have patterns
and fabrics for Renaissance costumes, Miles added.<br>
      <br>
Also at the feast, next year's monarch for the Renaissance Faire will
be chosen. It's a matter of luck: Anyone who'd like a chance to be the
monarch gets to partake of a special dessert that has a coin hidden
inside. The person who receives the piece of dessert with the hidden
coin is the new monarch.<br>
      <br>
The reigning monarch, chosen at the 2006 feast, is Holly Taylor, of
Collinwood, Tenn.<br>
