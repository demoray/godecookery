      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Lord William</u>: Lord
King, I present to you this gift, a chest
of Golden Unicorns, from Master Huen of Damebrigge, your master chef,
and
his assistants, Ladye Glynnis and Lord Cydifor.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>: We thank
you, Lord William, and our thanks also
to Master Huen and Lord Cydifor, and to the Ladye Glynnis.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Lord William</u>: Lord
King, Master Huen has also bade me say
unto you that, while traveling to our land from their own Kingdom of
AEthelmearc,
he and his heard many and sundry reports from pilgrims and travelers of
wildmen roaming the forests, yea verily even woodwoses spotted in the
forests
nigh the Crossroads at Elgin and the Limestone Marches in the east.
Which
same may even yet be on their way hither to work what manner of ill God
and our Ladye only know!</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>: Yea,
M&#8217;Lord verily have we even heard the very
same; that is why our Sheriff, Lord Ian of Arkenstone at our command,
has
taken a score of men-at-arms to the Crossroads at Elgin there to deal
with
any such evil he may find.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Lord William</u>:&nbsp;
Well said, Your Majestye.&nbsp; But, an
it please my Lord King,&nbsp; Master Huen even so bids you guard yon
chest
of Golden Wafers carefully, as Wildmen are wont to favor Unicorns.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>: We thank
you, and Master Huen, for thy concern,
but think it most unlikely that any such villainous creatures would
dare
invade the merriment of our feaste hall.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(The chest of wafers should be
placed in a prominent spot near the
High Table and left alone. Sometime during the dancing and merriment, a
woodwose will sneak into the hall and steal the chest, and take it back
and place it inside the rolling tower. When the King spots the missing
chest, he cries out):</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>: Guards!
To us, quickly! Our chest of Unicorn
Wafers has been stolen! By&#8217;r Ladye, it must verily even be the accursed
wildmen our steward warned us of afore! Search the hall! Find the
wretched
villains and bring them to us! Find our chest of Unicorns! Captain of
the
Guards, send a man to the Marches to summon Lord Ian back.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(While this dialogue is taking
place, the wildmen wheel in the rolling
tower which has the chest of wafers sitting on a shelf inside it. The
wildmen
dance and make sport and generally act like wildmen. Upon spotting the
woodwoses and tower the King might say):</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>:
Undersherrif Dickon, do you take your men and
subdue yon creatures! (To the audience the King says): Ye may see how
yon
wicked wildmen have taken our chest of wafers and do mock us and make
sport,
but we&nbsp; pray you, gentle people, be easy and fear not. Eat! Drink!
Be joyous with us! Our undersherrif and his men-at-arms will deal with
these villainous wildmen.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(The guards run up, then, on
Dickon&#8217;s orders, trot off to do his
bidding. They will engage the wildmen who throw mock stones at them, in
front of the seven foot high rolling tower. The men-at-arms use swords
to defeat the wildmen. The last wildman should die very dramatically.
Then
the Captain of the Guards could say something like):</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Captain of the Guards</u>:
My Lord Dickon, we have struck down
the woodwoses and beg leave to present His Majestye with his chest.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Lord Dickon</u>: Very well;
see it done. Your Majestye, may I
present thy chest of Wafers. (At the Captain&#8217;s command, the men-at-arms
bow and present the chest to the King.)</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>King Randall</u>: We thank
thee and thy stout lads, Lord Dickon.
And now Lord William, we bid our pages and squires come forthe and give
unto each and every one here assembled a Unicorn Wafer.</b><b></b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(William snaps his fingers and
the servers begin distributing the
wafers. While the Wafers are being handed out, William briefly explains
that the Wafers are deliciously edible, but can also be saved as
souvenirs
by leaving them un-refrigerated for a week or two. Then the feast
continues.
And there was much rejoicing and gladness of heart&#8230;)</b><b></b> </p>
