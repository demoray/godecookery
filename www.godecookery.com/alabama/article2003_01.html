Feast revives the flavor, setting, live entertainment and
mouth-watering cuisine of an authentic medieval banquet. This year's
feast will take place at 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 18, at the
Florence-Lauderdale Coliseum. JIM HANNON/TimesDaily.</span></small><br>

October is time-travel month in the Shoals. The Florence we know today
becomes the Florence of Italy in the 12th through 16th centuries during
this Renaissance Month.<br>
      <br>
"I love it," says Ashley Hurst, a University of North Alabama student.<br>
      <br>
"It's like living in a fantasy world for a weekend," Hurst says of the
Alabama Renaissance Faire, held the fourth weekend of October.<br>
      <br>
Authentic costumes play a major role in creating that illusion.<br>
      <br>
"The more costumes there are, the more festive the atmosphere," said
Billy Ray Warren, chairman of the Renaissance Roundtable.<br>
      <br>
"People who come in costume come for more than entertainment. They come
to participate."<br>
      <br>
For Shoals residents who wish to dress the part during faire
activities, authentic costume-creation help is available.<br>
      <br>
There will be a free costume-making workshop Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2
p.m. at the studio in the back yard of Kennedy-Douglass Center for the
Arts.<br>
      <br>
Anyone desiring a costume need only bring three yards of fabric and
themselves.<br>
      <br>
"The person will be measured, the pattern will be marked, cut out and
sewn," says Warren.<br>
      <br>
"This is our 17th year with the costume-making workshop and we have it
down to a fine art."<br>
      <br>
For the most authentic costume, the design and color of the fabric
should be similar to what was available at the time.<br>
      <br>
"Solid fabrics and earth tones are always good," says Warren. "For a
nobility costume, you can go so far as to use brocade. I would stay
away from floral patterns because the looms at the time would not have
been able to make those designs."<br>
      <br>
According to Warren, the clerks at Wilson Fabric Center and Hancock
Fabrics in Florence are helpful when it comes to choosing authentic
fabrics.<br>
      <br>
Costumes made at the workshop are fairly simple, tunic-style costumes
that can be dressed up or down with belts, scarves, jewelry, hats and
other accessories, depending on the imagination of the designer.<br>
      <br>
"When you see them at the faire, you'll never know it was just a basic
costume," Warren said. "People dress as beggars, peasants, gentry,
nobility and members of the church."<br>
      <br>
Hurst, who belly-dances at the faire, said, "I decided that I wanted an
authentic Renaissance costume.<br>
      <br>
"A friend and I saw gypsy costumes one year and thought that would be
something we would like to do.<br>
      <br>
"We had all these layers of clothes on and daggers tied around our
waists," Hurst said.<br>
      <br>
"We thought it was really cool."<br>
      <br>
The Renaissance Feast on Saturday, Oct. 18, offers a night of food and
entertainment in the Renaissance style.<br>
      <br>
"We start decorating Friday night and work all day Saturday. By that
night, it looks grand," says Warren.<br>
      <br>
"The chef, known as Master Huen, is Jim Matterer from West Virginia,"
said Warren.<br>
      <br>
The menu is based on authentic medieval-Renaissance recipes.<br>
      <br>
"Since the king this year is a wizard, the food this year will be an
illusion. It will look like one thing but be another," says Warren.<br>
      <br>
"It will all be delicious."<br>
      <br>
There will be interactive entertainment for those who want to
participate.<br>
      <br>
"We have a herald to announce everyone as they enter," Warren said.<br>
      <br>
"People will be able to go up to the high table and present themselves
before the king. Everyone will have the chance to join in a medieval
dance that will be taught on the spot."<br>
      <br>
"There will be a live chess game with people as the chess pieces,"
Warren said.<br>
      <br>
The feast features an exciting dessert to end the evening.<br>
      <br>
"Our coin-of-the-realm this year has Merlin engraved on it," said
Warren.<br>
      <br>
"A coin will be placed in one of the final desserts. The person who
finds the coin in their dessert gets to be the king or queen of next
year's faire."<br>
