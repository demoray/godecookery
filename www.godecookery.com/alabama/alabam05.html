      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><big><small>In Italy, the
Renaissance was the period of rebirth, sparking the revival of
classical arts and societal customs. Along with the renewed aesthetic
focus came the innate interest in science and medicine. With this, the
rebirth of the classical kitchen was in full swing. Now it was the
cook's job not just to prepare food for sustenance and pleasure, but
for its health generating properties as well. The long forgotten tomes
of Galen and Hippocrates were once again consulted, and their theories
prescribed for health and vitality in daily life.&nbsp; This ancient
system, known as the humoral theory, assigned common elements, such as
earth, air, fire, and water, and qualities like dry, moist, hot, and
cold, to all living things. In short, the humoral qualities of foods
were once again brought to the foreground and consumed for optimal
health and balance within the seasonal cycle.<br>
      </small></big></b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><big><small>With the newfound
focus on health, many noble families consulted artists and doctors
alike to produce manuscripts of instruction on optimal health.&nbsp;
One of the most beautiful and thorough of these text is the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Tacuinum Sanitatis in Medicina, The Four
Seasons In the House of Cerruti</span>. This 14th century Northern
Italian manuscript contains extensive information and detailed
illuminations
illustrating the gathering and preparation of foodstuffs and medicinal
herbs and preparations according to seasonal availability. The original
copy now resides Oesterreichische Nationalbibliothek in Vienna. Along
with the recipes of Platina's <span style="font-style: italic;">Dehoneste
Voluptate</span>, Gode Cookery is honored to present the
Festivit&agrave; Delle Quattro Stagioni... The Feast of the Four
Seasons.<br>

the wintertime, holds true. It is suggested that due to the cold moist
nature of the season, that food be increased and fluid consumption
decreased, lest it be a hearty and robust wine. Therefore winter ushers
in a shift in culinary preference toward hearty foods that are warming

larger than the size of an egg, in such a way that none is completely
severed from the other, right away, sprinkle them with salt and
coriander or ground fennel, having sprinkled them, press them a little
between two boards. Then pass a spit through them with pieces of lard
inserted so that the pieces of meat do not touch each other. Turn them
over the fire, seeing that they do not become to dry, until they are
cooked. This is of great and heavy nourishment. It is also slow to be
digested.</span><br>
      <br>
This recipe has been modified form the original by substituting modern
preparation and cooking techniques. The loin roasts were filleted into
flat steaks and the herbs and seasoning were dry rubbed onto the tops
of each. They were then rolled, tied, browned, and roasted in a slow
oven until tender.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Pound in a mortar pitted sour
cherries which can be called merendae. When they are pounded, mix into
them well cut-up red roses, a little fresh cheese, and ground aged
cheese, a bit of pepper, a little ginger, a little more sugar, and four
beaten eggs. When they are mixed, cook in a well-greased pan with a
lower crust on a slow fire. When they are taken off the fire, pour
sugar and rosewater over them. This does not differ much from the above
in force and pleasantness.<br>
      </span></b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Our recipe is a variation of
this original from Platina, leaving out the cut-up red roses and the
rosewater, substituting plums for cherries, and making a few minor
additions to the ingredients.<br>

King Cake also features a special design carved by Darell McCormick,
and appropriately shows a medieval crown. Inside one of the Bean King
Cakes has been baked a small, authentic Roman coin (in honor of our
Italian feast), and the lucky one who chooses this cake during the
ceremony will become the next king or queen and will reign over the
feast in 2006. Good luck to all of the ceremony participants, and
congratulations to the new monarch!<br>
