      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Feast<br>
      <br>
A Renaissance Feast, sponsored by the Alabama Renaissance Faire
Roundtable, is scheduled for 7 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 16, at the
Florence-Lauderdale Coliseum.<br>
      <br>
The meal, prepared by chef Jim Matterer of Morgantown, West Virginia,
whose specialty is Medieval and Renaissance foods, will feature a
plethora of period delicacies from his vast array of Medieval recipes.
Visit Jim's web site at www.godecookery.com; you will be amazed.<br>
      <br>
During the evening, there will be entertainment from the Renaissance
era performed by people dressed in the costumes of the period.<br>
      <br>
Those who attend the Feast are urged to don attire befitting the
Renaissance (though it's certainly not a requirement) and to bring
their own goblets or drinking vessels. Plates and silverware will be
provided as well, but guest are invited to bring their own to decorate
their place settings.<br>
      <br>
Better yet, groups of four or six might wish to bring their own table
linen, pewter or wooden plates, candelabra, etc. and set their own
table.<br>
      <br>
Tickets are available after Oct.1, at Kennedy-Douglass Art Center on
Tuscaloosa Street and Anderson's Bookland on North Court Street, both
in Florence.<br>
      <br>
For further information contact Billy R. Warren at (256) 768-3031. <br>
      <br>
The Faire<br>
      <br>
See and hear wandering minstrels. <br>
      <br>
Enjoy colorfully dressed court acrobats in motion. <br>
      <br>
Bask in the soothing sounds of dulcimers and recorders. <br>
      <br>
Delight in the vocal ranges of chamber singers. <br>
      <br>
All of these and much more will entertain those who attend the two-day
Alabama Renaissance Faire on Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 23-24.<br>
      <br>
The 18th annual Alabama Renaissance Faire has been scheduled for
Fountain-on-the-Green (Wilson Park) in downtown Florence. <br>
      <br>
Admission to the Faire is free.<br>
      <br>
Since the historical period known as the Renaissance had its start in
Florence, Italy, it is natural that the Alabama Renaissance Faire
should occur in that city's namesake, Florence, Ala. So it was that the
State Legislature passed a bill in the 1988 session designating the
Faire in Florence as the official Alabama Renaissance Faire. The
Governor signed it into law on February 4, 1988.<br>
      <br>
This year's Faire will feature foods, entertainment and crafts that
would have been available in Europe 500 years ago. <br>
      <br>
Fairgoers can eat turkey legs, fried veggies, funnel cakes and other
such delicacies while being entertained by jugglers, dancers,
violinists and actors. <br>
      <br>
They can purchase stained glass pieces or hand-thrown pottery, handmade
jewelry or homegrown herbs. <br>
      <br>
Along the way they can enjoy all the sights and sounds of a
Medieval-Renaissance village.<br>
      <br>
Hours for the Faire are 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. on Saturday and 12 p.m.
until 6 p.m. on Sunday.</span></div>
