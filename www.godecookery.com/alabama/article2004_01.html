is the 17th year for the feast, which will be Saturday, Oct. 16.
Preparing for the feast are (seated, from left) Carol Burhans, Donna
Miles,-Donna Montgomery; (standing, from left) Lee Freeman, Paul

      <font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
One look at Jim Matterer's Web site, www.godecookery.com, and it's
obvious that this guy is really into medieval and Renaissance food.<br>
      <br>
"I love it," said Matterer, who is also known in Renaissance circles as
Master Huen Damebrigge of Wychwood.<br>
      <br>
It was, in fact, Matterer's Web site that brought the expert in
medieval cookery to the attention of the Roundtable, the steering
committee of the Alabama Renaissance Faire in Florence.<br>
      <br>
"Lee Freeman found him on the Internet," said Billy Ray Warren,
Roundtable chairman.<br>
      <br>
"We invited him to prepare our feast in 2001, and this will be his
fourth visit to Florence. We have designated him as the premier chef of
the Alabama Renaissance Faire."<br>
      <br>
Matterer's Web site posts photos and menus from his first three visits
to Florence and keeps visitors informed of what will be taking place at
the Alabama Renaissance Faire this year.<br>
      <br>
"He is very proud of his Florence experience," Warren said. "He really
knows how to do an authentic feast."<br>
      <br>
      <big>Combined training</big><br>
      <br>
Matterer received his culinary training from a small community college.
It wasn't until later, however, that his interests focused on medieval
food.<br>
      <br>
"I decided to return to college and major in history," he said. "In the
'90s, I decided to combine the history and love of cooking and do
serious research."<br>
      <br>
It was the research that led Matterer to design his Gode Cookery Web
site, which includes "A Boke of Gode Cookery Recipes," along with other
helpful links such as a glossary of Medieval Cooking Terms for those of
us not so familiar with the world of Renaissance cookery.<br>
      <br>
His cooking skills have also brought him national television attention.<br>
      <br>
"I appeared on the Food Network earlier this year," he said.<br>
      <br>
Matterer is also known for his medieval cookies -- Goode Cookys -- that
he sells through his Web site.<br>
      <br>
"I'll be selling them at the faire," he said. "They're very big cookies
-- about 4 inches across and very detailed."<br>
      <br>
Matterer's explains on his site that during the Middle Ages and
Renaissance, small cakes or wafers were the predecessors of modern
cookies. Many of the cakes were created in a variety of shapes, sizes
and designs, produced by hand-carved molds that depicted images of
saints, elements of daily life and period patterns and motifs.<br>
      <br>
In this tradition, Goode Cookys are handmade from historical molds and
bring to life the elaborate and decorative cakes, wafers and
gingerbread of the Middle Ages.<br>
      <br>
At the feast, Matterer will be distributing platters of six different
kinds of cookies in six different flavors.<br>
      <br>
"I'm hoping people will keep those more than eat them," Matterer joked.<br>
      <br>
      <big>Coming home</big><br>
      <br>
Matterer, who lives in Pennsylvania, said returning to Florence for his
fourth year is almost like coming home.<br>
      <br>
"I consider Florence as a second home," he said. "In fact, I come a
week early to see friends and hang out with the Roundtable."<br>
      <br>
The medieval cookery master said Florence is unique when it comes to
Renaissance faires.<br>
      <br>
"This is the only faire that I know of that does a sit-down feast like
this," Matterer said.<br>
      <br>
For the feast, has put together an impressive menu, that will include
paynedemayne, buttir, sallet, Broet d'Almaniz, garroites, benes yfryed,
chike endored, Minnesanger wafer, champignons, Beuf Comme Venoison
d'Ours, amplummus and gauffres.<br>
      <br>
For those who don't understand Middle English text, here's the
translation:<br>
      <br>
Payndemayne -- white bread.<br>
      <br>
Buttir -- butter.<br>
      <br>
Sallet -- salad of various lettuces, herbs and fruits.<br>
      <br>
Broet d'Alamaniz -- German broth, which is a chicken and pork soup made
with almond milk and spices.<br>
      <br>
Garrorites -- Carrots cooked in honey.<br>
      <br>
Benes yfryed -- Fava beans, onions and garlic browned in olive oil and
spices.<br>
      <br>
Chike endored -- Roast chicken in a golden egg glaze.<br>
      <br>
Minnesanger wafer -- A molded cake or wafer.<br>
      <br>
Champignons -- Mushrooms and cheese.<br>
      <br>
Beuf Comme Venoison d'Ours -- "Beef to taste like bear," which further
translates into roast beef accompanied with a black pepper sauce.<br>
      <br>
Amplummus -- Fried apples in cream, eggs, cinnamon and sugar.<br>
      <br>
Gauffres -- Cakes and wafers.<br>
      <br>
      <big>Delicious and entertaining</big><br>
      <br>
While food is the center of attention for the Renaissance Feast,
entertainment also plays a big role.<br>
      <br>
"We're going to have a jolly time this year," said Donna Miles of the
Roundtable.<br>
      <br>
Performing will be troupes with musical instruments representative of
the Middle Ages, David Hope as a storyteller, songs by Sir William the
Great (William Freeman), authentic Renaissance dancers and bellydancers.<br>
      <br>
Also performing will be Sadie the Magic Dog.<br>
      <br>
"Sadie is a black lab who owns Debbie Collum," said Miles. "Sadie is a
registered therapy dog and she's going to be doing tricks for us."<br>
      <br>
      <big>Tickets available</big><br>
      <br>
Warren advises feastgoers to purchase their tickets, early as seating
will be limited to 200.<br>
      <br>
Tickets for the feast, which begins at 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 16, are
$20 each. They are available at Anderson's Bookland and
Kennedy-Douglass Center for the Arts.<br>
      <br>
In conjunction with the feast and faire, a costume-making clinic will
be held from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m.-Saturday.<br>
      <br>
The clinic is free, and attendees are asked to bring 3 yards of
60-inch-wide material.<br>
      <br>
"You actually walk away with a finished tunic," Warren said.<br>
      <br>
The following recipes are from Matterer's Web site<br>
      <br>
Clarrey was wine to which honey and spices were added; the name comes
from the Latin vinum claratum, which means "clarified wine." The name
survives today as claret, a dry, red wine.<br>
      <br>
CLARREY<br>
      <br>
Description: Wine mulled with honey and spices<br>
      </span></font>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
bottle (750 mll) of an inexpensive, sweet white wine</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1 to
2 cups honey</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
tablespoon each cinnamon, galingale (or substitute ginger) and cardamom</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
teaspoon white pepper</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cheesecloth</span></font></li>
      </ul>
      <font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bring the
wine and honey to a boil; reduce heat and skim off the scum as it
rises. Taste for sweetness; add honey as necessary. Remove from heat,
stir in spices and allow to sit covered for 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
After sitting, the spices will create at thick residue, which will
settle to the bottom. Using a ladle, pass the wine into another
container through a strainer lined with two or three layers of
cheesecloth to remove the spices, being careful to leave as much of the
spice reside in the pot as possible. Bottle. Make at least one month
before serving.<br>
      <br>
BRYNDONS<br>
      <br>
Description: Small cakes in sauce of wine, fruit and nuts<br>
      </span></font>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">4&frac12;
cups flour</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2
cups sugar</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&frac12;
cup (or more) cold water</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Few
drops yellow food coloring</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&frac14;
teaspoon salt</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vegetable
oil</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
bottle (750 mll) of an inexpensive sweet red wine</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1&frac12;
cups honey</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&frac12;
cup red wine vinegar</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Few
drops red food coloring</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
teaspoon each pepper, cloves and mace</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&frac12;
cup each chopped dates, currants and pine nuts (or slivered almonds)</span></font></li>
        <li><font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">1
cup figs, diced</span></font></li>
      </ul>
      <font class="gen_art"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simmer the
figs in a little wine; set aside. Bring the wine and honey to a boil;
reduce the heat and skim off the scum until clean. Add the vinegar, red
coloring, pepper, cloves, mace fruits, figs and nuts; return to a boil
then reduce heat to a low simmer.<br>
      <br>
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, sugar and salt. Dye the
water yellow with a few drops of coloring, then slowly work into the
flour enough of the water to make a smooth dough, similar to pie-pastry.<br>
      <br>
Roll out on a floured board, then cut in strips about 1-inch wide and 4
inches long. In a deep skillet or pan, fry the strips in oil until
lightly browned and very crisp. Drain. Place the cakes on a serving
platter, then spoon on the fruits and nuts, being generous with the
syrup. The yellow cakes and the red topping make an interest contrast
in colors and the wine will soften the cakes.<br>
      <br>
Makerouns appear to the the ancestor of macroni and this dish may best
be described as "medieval mac-n-cheese." The period receipt advises to
prepare it like "losyns" (lasagna) with layers of noodles, butter and
cheese. Matterer says cheddar cheese is the tastiest, but advises to
try other varieties.<br>
      <br>
