The modern recipe is a combination of elements of both period receipts;
the result is a delightful and unusual salad which is both new and
familiar
to modern diners. For the Alabama Feast, the green onions &amp;
scallions
listed in the first original receipt and included in the modern version
have been left out as green onions are featured in the following
course,
in the French Iowtes. Similarly, the almonds from the second receipt
have
been replaced with walnuts, as almonds play a major part throughout the
entire feast and need not be included here as well. The fresh herbs
used
included parsley and other appropriate fresh herbs obtained just prior
to the feast.</b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Haslet was the intestines and
organ meats of animals of the hunt,
the &#8220;offal&#8221; that is rejected today. In the Middle Ages, however, this
part
of the animal was a sought-after trophy, and &#8220;haslet,&#8221; roasted on a
spit,
was brought into the feast hall with great ceremony and presented with
honor. The first two period receipts present a mock haslet, composed of
fruits roasted in such a way as to resemble the real thing. In the
first
receipt, the haslet is made of fruit strung together with needle and
thread,
such as popcorn or cranberries on a modern Christmas tree. These
strings
of fruit, each the length of a man&#8217;s height, are wrapped around a spit,
and as they roast are basted in a wine batter. In the second receipt,
fruit
is placed on a spit and given a coating of batter of flour and egg
yolks
as they roast. The third receipt is a simple fritter recipe of apples,
carrots, &amp; parsnips. Our modern version, therefore, is an
adaptation
of all three of these fried fruit recipes.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Using the apples &amp;
parsnips of the third recipe, our haslet is
placed on skewers, the spit used in the second recipe. Recipes 1 &amp;
2 have the haslet coated in batter; recipe 3 deep fries the
batter-coated
fruit pieces. Our haslet is thus made by placing alternate pieces of
apple
and parsnip on a wooden skewer, dipping this in batter, then
deep-frying
in hot oil until brown. The end result looks very much indeed like
roasted
meat on a small spit, but with a decidedly different taste! Our final
garnish
is honey, an appropriate substitute for almond milk and the most
popular
medieval sweetener.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The name Trayne Roste refers
to the length and arrangement of the
haslet along with its cooking procedure &#8211; a &#8220;train&#8221; of roasted items.</b></div>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Almond Milk</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>In the Middle Ages, animal
milk was, of course, not refrigerated,
and fresh milk did not stay fresh for long. Most cooks simply did not
use
much milk as the short shelf-life of the product made it a difficult
ingredient
to depend upon. Many recipe collections of the time advise that cooks
should
only rely on milk that comes directly from a cow, something not
possible
at all times, and purchasing milk was a dubious practice, for
streetsellers
of milk often sold wares that were either spoiled or diluted with
water.
Milk's use had to be immediate, in cooking or by turning into cheese
&amp;
butter. It was these difficulties that forced Medieval cooks to look
upon
milk with great reluctance, and so having milk in the kitchen was
usually
unheard of.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Rather than animal milk,
Medieval cooks turned to something they
could depend upon, and that was the milky liquid produced by grinding
almonds
or walnuts. This liquid, high in natural fats, could be prepared fresh
whenever needed in whatever quantities. It also could be made well
ahead
of time and stored with no danger of degeneration. Because of its high
fat content, it, like animal milk, could be churned into butter, and
because
it was not animal milk, it could be used and consumed during Church
designated
meatless days.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Almond milk was used
extensively in period; all existing cookbooks
call for it, and it must have been found in literally every Medieval
kitchen.
It's the prime ingredient in many, many recipes, and the modern cook
recreating
Medieval food will have to learn its production in order to prepare the
most common of dishes. Fortunately, it's easily made.</b> </p>
      <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li> <b>1 cup ground almonds&nbsp;</b></li>
        <li> <b>2 cups boiling water</b></li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Combine almonds and water.
Steep for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Sieve the mixture to remove coarse grains OR (preferably) blend mixture
in electric blender until grains are absorbed. Yield - 2 cups almond
milk.</b></div>
