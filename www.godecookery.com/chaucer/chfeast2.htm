<p><b>Now, what menu to choose for A Chaucerian Feast? For a complete
list
of the foods Chaucer mentions in his writings, refer to <a
 href="http://www.labs.net/dmccormick/huen/chaucer/chauc3.htm">Chaucer's
Foods</a>, Part 3 of A Chaucerian Cookery. Here you will find apples,
grapes,
bread, wine, ale, honey, capon, beef, and all sorts of foods that need
little or no explanation. There are also, however, dishes that are very
specific, such as <i>mortreux</i> and <i>blankmanger</i>, which are
no
longer familar in the 20th century. These true Medieval favorites must
play an important part in any recreated Chaucerian feast, along with
the
more simple, familiar foods. And with the modern sources mentioned
previously,
it's possible to find many different recipes that correspond exactly to
Chaucer's <i>bake mete, chiknes with the marybones,</i> and the other
edibles
of his characters. A Chaucerian feast can contain any number of these
dishes,
in any of their variations - blankmanger was made with fish or chicken,
or as a sweet almond dessert; meat pies were concocted in infinite
variations;
and, of course, there were many ways to roast goose or cook fish. The
final
decision in all these matters is, of course, the cook's. Keeping cost,
availability, and the type of guests being served in mind, one can be
creative
and present a dozen such feasts, each different from the other.</b></p>
<p><b>In the sample feast presented here are found all the specifically
named dishes, as well some of the simpler foods, presented in 4 courses
and arranged in accordance with the dietary beliefs of the time. This
feast
menu can be used as is, or followed as a model in the creation of your
own Chaucerian Feast.</b></p>

<p><b>Begin the feast by serving the <i>Clarree</i> and offering a
toast,
then bring out the First Course. Use whole loaves of bread &amp; allow
diners to help themselves by tearing off pieces. Have butter in small
dishes,
&amp; present the cheese whole or sliced. Use a good English or French
cheese, such as Stilton or Brie. Diners may wish to eat the <i>Mortreux</i>
as a pate with the bread &amp; cheese, but will prefer the <i>Blankmanger</i>
eaten as a separate item.</b></p>
<p><b>After this appetizer course, the diners will be ready for the
larger
Second Course. The chicken should be served on a platter, family style,
as should the <i>Pesen</i> &amp; <i>Wortes</i>. Let people help
themselves
to pieces of the fish in sauce, along with the walnuts. Satiate your
guest's
thirst with plenty of wine &amp; ale.</b></p>
<p><b>After the Second Course, give your guests some time to digest
before
the next dishes are brought out. This is the moment for a break for
talk,
stories, a little entertainment, and perhaps some music or even a
little
dancing. Keep your guest's glasses full!</b></p>
<p><b>By the Third Course, your guests will be only in the mood for
smaller
portions. Serve out small pieces of the pie, and present the goose
whole
and allow a special guest to carve. Allow the guests to nibble on the
cheese
&amp; nuts as they please. The fecches here can be considered either a
vegetable or a sweet to end the course with. <i>Ypocras</i> can be
served
up until the time of the <i>Void&euml;</i>.</b></p>
<p><b>At this point, the feast is technically over. The <i>Void&euml;</i>
is meant to be a small repast presented just before the guests leave or
retire, so have your well-fed company leave the table and relax for
awhile
in more informal surroundings, then bring out dessert. Lay the <i>Void&euml;</i>
out on a small table and let everyone help themselves. Arrange the
foods
on small serving platters or dessert bowls, provide some small dessert
plates, and a few spoons. Place the honey in small bowls as garnish for
the apples, pears, &amp; wafers.</b></p>
