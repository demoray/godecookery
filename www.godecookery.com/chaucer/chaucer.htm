<P><IMG SRC="ccook21.gif" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=91 WIDTH=70 ALIGN=LEFT><B>The
exact date of Chaucer's birth is not known, though it is generally believed
to be somewhere between 1340 and 1350. His family can be traced back four
generations to Robert le Taverner of Ipswich, who died about 1280. The
family's original home was in Ipswich, but it seems that they always had
business interests in London as well. Robert the Taverner was known in
London as Robert Malyn, and Malyn may been the original family name. Robert's
grandson (also named Robert) was Geoffrey's grandfather, and appears in
various records under several different names: Robert Malyn, Robert le
Dennington (a village near Ipswich), Robert the Saddler, and Robert Chaucer.
The name Chaucer means a maker of <I>chausses</I>, a kind of shoe, so the
modern equivalent might be Shoemaker. The family interests had always been
connected with the leather and wine trades. Geoffrey's mother is believed
to have been Agnes de Copton, and his father was John, a vintner. They
lived in London, where the family resided at their business on Thames Street.
They were of the prosperous middle class.</B></P>

<P><B>As Geoffrey was brought up in the cosmopolitan society of trade,
he received a good education and could read and write in both French and
English. In 1357 he became a page in the household of the Duchess of Ulster,
the daughter-in-law of King <IMG SRC="ccook22.gif" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=375 WIDTH=300 ALIGN=RIGHT>Edward
III. After five years he was promoted to squire. In 1359 was sent abroad
to fight in what is now called The Hundred Year's War. He was captured
near Rheims and was eventually ransomed off for 16 pounds, about $40,000
in modern money. The fact that King Edward paid for part of the ransom
indicates that he was already being highly thought of. In 1366 he married
Philippa de Roet, lady-in-waiting to the Queen, and sister-in-law to John
of Gaunt, son of Edward III. More than likely this was an arranged political
marriage and he felt no true companionship towards her, as he never dedicated
poems to his wife or ever directly referred to her. His literary allusions
to married life are mostly ironical and unflattering.</B></P>

<P><B>In 1373 he was sent to Italy on a trade mission and it was here that
he became influenced by what was then the finest art and literature in
the world. This experience had a tremendous effect on his development as
a poet. He returned to London in 1374 and was made Controller of Customs
on wools, skins, and hides in the Port of London. From 1374 to 1386 he
traveled a great deal on the King's business, and for his diligent work
received from the King the grant of a pitcher of wine daily for life. Also
at this time John the Gaunt became his patron and gave him a life-pension.
The City of London also gave him the lease of his house over Aldgate gate,
where he stayed until 1385. It was the happiest period of his life, and
it was then that he began to write his poetry. It was Chaucer who at this
time introduced England to the new Italian style of poetry, perhaps the
first breath of the Renaissance in London. He also wrote in the fashionable
French-Medieval style, and was the first poet to write in English a poem
using heroic couplet, later to become one of the most popular of verse
forms. In 1386 he was made a Justice of the <IMG SRC="ccook23.gif" HSPACE=10 HEIGHT=260 WIDTH=207 ALIGN=LEFT>Peace
and elected to Parliament as Knight of the Shire of Kent. Poet, diplomat,
and man of business, Chaucer was a figure of position and influence.</B></P>

<P><B>Shortly thereafter his luck changed. When John of Gaunt was sent
away on a military expedition and was replaced at King Richard's court,
Geoffrey lost all his positions. Despite John's return in 1389, things
were never quite the same for him, and even with an increase in his pension
his finances were never again secure. He was appointed a clerkship which
he lost in 1391, and soon both his wife and John of Gaunt had passed away.
It was during this, a most unhappy time, that he began writing <I>The Canterbury
Tales</I>, his most famous work. His last poems speak of sadness, of growing
old, and of disillusionment. He never finished <I>The Canterbury Tales</I>.
He died on October 25, 1400, and was the first poet to be buried in the
section of Westminster Abbey that is now called Poet's Corner.</B></P>

<P><B>Chaucer certainly did not make his living being a poet, though his
pieces were enormously popular. He wrote for the sake of the art form,
and his early writings reflect the life of the nobility and court he was
familiar <IMG SRC="ccook24.gif" HEIGHT=218 WIDTH=96 ALIGN=RIGHT>with. Works
such as <I>The Parliament of Fowles</I>, <I>The House of Fame</I>, and
<I>The Legend of Good Women</I> are all about, and intended for, the wealthy
upper class. In 1386, when much of his life changed, so did his poetry.
While living in Kent, missing his former life and home in London, he began
writing <I>The Canterbury Tales</I>, a masterpiece that is not about the
nobles or royals who had turned their backs on him, but about the people
of the new and quickly emerging middle class. The story itself deals with
a group of pilgrims, none of whom have greater status than members of the
clergy and some who were common laborers and workers. Each one must tell
two tales during their pilgrimage, and the tales themselves make up the
bulk of the poem. At first this writing was simply an escape from outward
and inward pressures, but soon he found pleasure in it. In the <I>Tales</I>
he was able to comment on and laugh about the society that seemed to be
falling in pieces around him. The work ended up not only being about the
middle class, but for them as well, and he amusingly included himself among
the cast of common characters who make their pilgrimage to Canterbury.</B></P>

<P><B>Although Chaucer was an over-weight man, it is known that he was
very conservative in his diet and did not go to extremes in either quality
or quantity. Food was simply not that important to him, and this attitude
is reflected most in his early writings. There is scarcely any mention
of food or eating in his courtly poems, only the occasional feast which
is hardly discussed and certainly never described in great detail. Bread,
ale, and wine are often mentioned, but other foods are not specifically
defined: roasted meat, drink, etc. Such references are used only to add
color or flavoring to the story, and don't give the modern culinary historian
much to work on.</B></P>

<P><B><I>The Canterbury Tales</I> is a much different matter. Chaucer once
again treats food only as a literary prop, but the types of dishes and
foods that his characters consume are very effective clues to their personalities,
habits, and traits, and help bring <I>The Canterbury Tales</I> to life.
The Summoner's disreputable personality is heightened by the fact that
he was fond of garlic and onions, a diet that would lead to a bad complexion
and foul breath. The Prioress, who perhaps loves the finer life a bit too
much, ate only the daintiest of morsels and fed her dogs only the finest
of white bread while peasants were lucky to get only brown. The Franklin's
generous character and wealth are reflected in the mention of his table,
which was always prepared for dinner and where it &quot;snowed&quot; all
manner of food and drink. At his house there was the finest of wines and
meat pies, and his ponds were well-stocked with delicious fish. Friars,
known for their love of good food and wine, were frequent guests of such
wealthy men of property, a fact Chaucer's friar comments on at one point.
Chaucer's monk was also a lover of the good life, and enjoyed hunting so
much he usually preferred catching a rabbit for his dinner over ecclesiastical
fare.</B></P>

<P><B>In contrast to these rich pilgrims is the poor widow of the <I>Nun's
Priest's Tale</I>, who leads a simple life: <I>&quot;Of spiced sauce she
had no need at all. No dainty morsel passed through her throat; her diet
was in keeping with her coat...she drank no wine, neither white nor red.
Her table was served most with white and black, milk and brown bread, of
which she had no lack, broiled bacon, and sometimes an egg or two.&quot;</I></B></P>

<P><B>Of course, the character of Roger Hodge, the wealthy quildsmen's
hired cook, adds a great deal of culinary detail to the <I>Tales</I>. He
was quite proficient at several dishes, including <I>blancmange</I> and
<I>mortreux</I>, both common and popular during Chaucer's time. His cook
could roast, boil, broil, and fry, but an intense depth is added to his
character when it is revealed that he sells stale pasties and his stuffed
goose frequently contains some of the flies that infest his shop! Clearly,
Chaucer uses food as a way of introducing important elements of his pilgrim's
characters, and even to infuse a little humor. </B></P>
