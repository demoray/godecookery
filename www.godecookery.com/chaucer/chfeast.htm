- Troilus &amp; Criseyde, Book II</i></b></p>
</center>
<p><b>Chaucerian cooking has been the subject of a few modern
cookbooks,
including <i>Pleyn Delit</i>, Maggie Black's <i>A Medieval Cookbook</i>,
and <i>Fabulous Feasts</i>, and it's possible to plan a Chaucerian
feast
based simply on the material in these books. Those new to Medieval
cooking
should begin with the recipes found there. <i>Pleyn Delit</i> also
features
several model Chaucerian feasts, both small and large, while <i>Fabulous
Feasts</i> has a chapter entitled <i>"A Chicken for Chaucer's Kitchen,"</i>
where Squire Geoffrey embarks on a fictional journey through the food
sellers
and markets of London in order to procure ingredients for a farsed
chicken.
The chapter is rich in information and details on 14th c. London and
its
food districts.</b></p>
<p><b>However, going directly to period sources for research should be
the goal of any historical food recreationist, and to accomplish this
task
one can rely on several medieval cookbooks available today which were
also
around during Chaucer's time. The primary recipe source for Chaucer is
<i>The Forme of Curye,</i> compiled by the cooks of Richard II<i>. </i>Chaucer
would certainly have eaten some of the dishes prepared by these very
cooks,
and such recipes as <i>blankmanger</i> and <i>mortreux</i> are found
here.
The <i>Forme of Curye</i> is available today as part of a 14th c.
recipe
collection called <i>Curye on Inglish</i>, which also contains 3 other
manuscripts from Chaucer's time: <i>Diuersa Cibaria</i>, <i>Diuersa
Servicia</i>,
&amp; <i>Utilis Coquinario</i>. These four main resources provide a
wealth
of Chaucerian material.</b></p>
<p><b>Appearing shortly after the arrival of <i>The Forme of Curye,</i>
a collection known today as <i>An Ordinance of Pottage</i> may have
been
modeled on <i>Curye</i>, and contains corresponding recipes. It is in
print
today, with redactions by Constance B. Hieatt.</b></p>
<p><b>Other invaluable books that are contemporary with Chaucer are <i>Le
Viandier de Taillevent</i>, the cookbook of Guillame Taillevent written
in the 1370's and recently edited for publication by Terence Scully;
Chiquart's
<i>On Cookery</i>, also written in the 1300s; and <i>Le Menagier de
Paris</i>,
a set of domestic instructions &amp; recipes written around 1393 by a
wealthy
Parisian householder, a man very similar to Chaucer's Franklin.</b></p>
<p><b>The next best source after these would probably be Thomas
Austin's
<i>Two 15th-Century Cookery-Books</i>, originally published in 1888,
but
featuring English manuscripts from 1425 - 1450. This is a little out of
Chaucer's time period, but close enough to still be considered a viable
reference.</b></p>
<p><b>In addition, Terence Scully's <i>The Art of Cookery in the
Middle
Ages</i> provides an excellent background in understanding the nature
of
cooking &amp; food production in Chaucer's time, as well as detailing
the
presentation of courses in period banquets.</b></p>
<p><b>And so, with these sources in hand, and with the knowledge of
Chaucer
before us, the creation of a Chaucerian feast for a dozen guests or
dinner
for just a few is easily done, and is only limited by time, resources,
and imagination.</b></p>

</center>
<p><b>First, let's begin with the arrangement of a Medieval meal.
Dinners
&amp; feasts usually started with foods that were considered easily
digestible,
such as light meats, warm &amp; moist foods such as soups and broths,
moist
fruits (especially peaches), and greens such as lettuce, cabbage, and
"herbs."
Spices were thought to warm the stomach, and were therefore an
excellent
stomach opener. Cheese was eaten both before and during the meal, as an
aid to digestion and to help a "weak stomach."</b></p>
<p><b>Foods that were more difficult to digest, such as beef &amp; pork
and heavy fruits, like pears &amp; chestnuts, were consumed later in
the
meal. In large feasts, very rich and exotic foods were served in
smaller
portions only to highly distinguished guests after the more filling and
common dishes had been served to the entire hall. This practice would
continue
as the feast progressed, ending with the finest of delicacies being
served
to just the table of the king or nobleman in charge of the affair.</b></p>
<p><b>When meat was eaten, it was normally followed with cheese, which
even physicians recommended for proper digestion. When fish was served,
it was followed with nuts, for essentially the same reason.</b></p>
<p><b>Wines and ales of all sorts were consumed during the entire meal.</b></p>
<p><b>Sweets, like today, were saved for last, and spices were again
used
here as a digestive aid to end the meal. Wine, as a custom, was drunk
just
before retiring, and so the evening would usually end with a snack of
sweet
fruits &amp; cakes, &amp; spiced wines. This little repast was called
the
<i>Voide.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Dinners were arranged in courses, each course containing several
items, with several courses in each dinner. A feast may contain many
courses
with just a few dishes in each, or just a few courses with many dishes
included. After the final course came the <i>Voide.</i></b></p>
<p><b>At royal feasts, the courses were broken up with lavish
presentations
and spectacles, and fantastic and fanciful foods called <i>solteties</i>
were presented. These exotic creations were crafted mainly from sugar
and
made to represent saints, warriors, heroes, scenes from mythology, etc.</b></p>

Prologue to The Monk's Tale</i></b></p>
</center>
<p><b>A modern Chaucerian feast should follow the traditional standards
of Chaucer's time. Begin dinner with soup or broth, bread, &amp;
cheese.
Follow with green vegetables, a meat dish of pork and chicken, or
perhaps
fish, accompanied with sauces, then move on to the heavier and fancier
items, in smaller portions. End with sweets and spiced desserts. Serve
wine and ale throughout the entire meal. Divide the various dishes
among
two or three courses, serving each course in its entirety and leaving
time
for talk, music, &amp; entertainment for guests between courses. Make
sure
to fill your glasses in a toast to Squire Geoffrey as you enjoy a <i>"gentil
pasture"</i> of good food and company.</b></p>
