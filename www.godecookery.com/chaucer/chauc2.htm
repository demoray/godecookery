<p><b>One of the longer food descriptions in the <i>Tales</i> occurs
during the Franklin's introduction in the prologue: </b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>A Frankelyn was in his companye;</i>/A Franklin was in

<p><b><i>His breed, his ale, was alwey after oon;</i>/His bread,

</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>A bettre envyned man was no-wher noon.</i>/A more envied
man was nowhere found.</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>With-oute bake mete was never his hous,</i>/Without meat
pie was never his house,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Of fish and flesh, and that so plenteous,</i>/Of fish

</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke,</i>/It snowed

</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Of alle deyntes that men could thinke.</i>/Of all dainties

</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>After the sondry seasons of the yeer,</i>/According to

</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>So chaunged he his mete and his soper.</i>/He varied his

<center>
<p><b><i><font size="-1">A "table dormant," filled with

</center>
<p><b>The Franklin's wealth and fondness for well-prepared food is
reminiscent
of another famous 14th c. literary figure, the Goodman of Paris, whose
advice to his young bride survives today as <i>Le Menagier de Paris</i>,
one of the best examples of medieval domestic duties and cookery.</b></p>
<p><b>The cook, Roger Hodge, also called Hodge of Ware, was actually
based
on a real London cook known to Chaucer, a Roger Ware. (Hodge was a
nickname
of Roger). Chaucer obviously intended for his London readers to
recognize
this poor cook with the sore on his knee. Although his introduction in
the <i>Tales</i> is not as long as the Franklin's, it is just as rich
in
the mention of food and prepared dishes: </b></p>
<center>
<p><b><i>A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones,</i>/A Cook they
had with them for the occasion,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>To boille the chicknes with the mary-bones,</i>/To boil
the chickens with the marrow-bones,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>And poudre-marchant tart, and galingale.</i>/And tart
flavoring, and spice.</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Wel coude he knowe a draughte of London ale.</i>/Well
could he appreciate a draught of <img src="ccook27.gif" align="right"
 height="263" width="189">London
ale.</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>He coulde roste, and sethe, and broille, and frye,</i>/He
could roast, and boil, and broil, and fry,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye.</i>/Make stew, and
well bake a pie.</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me,</i>/But a great
pity was it, as I thought,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>That on his shine a mormal hadde he;</i>/That on his shin
a bad sore had he;</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>For blankmanger, that made he with the beste.</i>/As for
blancmange, that he made with the best. </b></p>
</center>

<p><b><i><font size="-1">A contemporary portrait of Roger
Hodge</font></i></b></p>
</div>
<p><b>Another description of his abilities occurs in the Cook's
prologue
to his tale, but is far from complimentary. The host of the pilgrimage
accuses Roger of not only selling warmed over and stale pasties, but of
having so many flies in his shop that they often end up in the food.
His
poor, stubble-fed geese were so badly prepared that the host tells him,
<i>"From many a pilgrim hast thou Christ's curse."</i></b></p>
<p><b>Cooks are also featured in an unsavory manner in <i>The
Pardoner's
Tale</i>. After a long discourse on the sin of Gluttony, we read: </b></p>
<center>
<p><b><i>Thise cooks, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde,</i>/Those
cooks, how they pound, and strain, and grind,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>And turnen substance in-to accident,</i>/And turn substance
into accident,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>To fulfille al thy likerous talent!</i>/To fulfill all
your greedy appetites!</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Out of the harde bones knokke they</i>/Out of the hard
bones they knock</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>The Mary, for they caste noght a-wey</i>/The marrow, for
they throw nothing away</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>That may go thurgh the golet softe and swote;</i>/That
may go through the gullet soft and sweet;</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Of spicerye, of leef, and bark, and rote</i>/Of spices,
of leaf and bark and root</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>Shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt,</i>/Shall his delicious
sauce be made,</b></p>
</center>
<center>
<p><b><i>To make him yet a newer appetyt.</i>/To provide him with
a newer appetite. </b></p>

      <td><b>Feasts are mentioned several times throughout Chaucer's
writings,
including the seldom discussed <i>Troilus and Criseyde</i>. But as
stated
previously, these are all very brief and seldom include descriptive
scenes
helpful to modern cooks.</b>
      <p><b>An elaborate banquet featuring a pantomimic siege is
described in
      <i>The Franklin's Tale:</i> <i>"For often at feasts, I have
heard
told, that magicians within a large hall, have made appear water and a
barge, and made it sail up and down the hall. Sometimes there seemed to
appear a fierce lion; and sometimes flowers sprang up as in a meadow;
sometimes
a vine and white and red grapes; sometimes a castle made of stone and
mortar;
and when they pleased made it disappear."</i> Such spectacles, designed
for the entertainment of feasters, were common during Chaucer's period.
On January 6, 1378, Charles the V of France entertained the Emperor
Charles
IV in the Royal palace of Paris with a pantomime representing the
arrival
of the Crusaders and the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.</b></p>
