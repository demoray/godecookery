<p><b><i>Again, pears cooked without coals or water: to instruct
the person who will be cooking them, he should get a good new
earthenware
pot, then get the number of pears he will be wanting to cook and put
them
into that pot; when they are in it, stop it up with clean little sticks
of wood in such a way that when the pot is upside down on the hot coals
it does not touch them at all; then turn it upside down on the hot
coals
and keep it covered over with coals and leave it to cook for an hour or
more. Then uncover them and check whether they have cooked enough, and
leave them there until they are cooked enough. When they are cooked,
put
them out into fine silver dishes; then they are borne to the sick
person.</i></b></p>

<p><b>This recipe is much less elaborate than it appears, and is
simply pears baked in an oven, very much like our contemporary baked
apple
but without the addition of sugar &amp; spices. Baked pears were
thought
to have medicinal properties and were one of the foods considered
appropriate
for the ill, hence the instruction to give them to the sick person.
Feasts
often ended with baked apples &amp; pears, served with the other
confections
of the dessert course. As that is their function here, the modern
recipe
has been sweetened with a little cinnamon &amp; sugar.</b></p>

<ul>
  <li><b>apples &amp; pears, cored</b></li>
  <li><b>cinnamon &amp; sugar to taste</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Place whole, cored fruit in a baking dish or pan and bake at
400&deg;
F until the fruit has completely turned a deep brown, about 1/2 hour to
45 minutes. Sprinkle with cinnamon &amp; sugar, and eat with honey as a
garnish.</b></p>
