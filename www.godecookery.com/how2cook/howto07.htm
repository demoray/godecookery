      <b></b>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>One of the most vital features
of medieval feasts were trenchers,
plates cut from stale loaves of bread and which were used to hold food,
salt, and even candles during the feast. Every diner ate off one, and
there
were even servants whose specific task during mealtime was the carving
and presentation of trenchers, the finest and most delicate given to
the
king or ranking nobility. Used trenchers, full of sauces and covered in
bits of food, were given to the festal dogs or presented to the poor,
who
waited hungrily outside, as alms. Sadly, in today's recreated dinners
the
trencher is more often than not replaced by the bread bowl, which is a
sorry substitution for the real thing.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bridget Ann Henisch, author of
      <i>Fast and Feast</i>, reveals these
important facts on the trenchers of the Middle Ages:</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"After its importance as food,
the most useful role bread played
at table was as a plate, or trencher. A trencher could be made of many
different materials, earthenware, wood, or metal, but well into the
sixteenth
century it was often made of bread. The word is derived from the French
verb <i>trenchier</i> or <i>trancher</i>, to cut, and the plate was
made
freshly for each meal by cutting off a slice from the loaf. It soaked
up
gravy, and could be eaten by the diner, tossed to a favorite dog, or
tidied
away with all the other remains and given to the poor. A clean trencher
was prepared once or twice during an elaborate meal as the table was
swept
clean between each course, the servants removing '<i>all broke cromys,
bonys and trenchours before the secunde cours and servise be served.'</i></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Any man who ate his own
trencher must have been particularly hungry,
as the bread used was rather coarse and stale, to make it solid enough
for the purpose. The flour was unbolted and the loaf itself several
days
old: <i>'trencher bred iii dayes (old) is convenyent and agreable.'</i>
The Goodman of Paris adds the information that a trencher should be <i>'half
a foot wide and four inches high.'</i> In texture it was close and firm
enough to be used sometimes as a candle holder.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"An ordinary diner made his
own trencher after he sat down at the
table, by cutting off a slice from the nearest loaf, but the most
important
people present expected to be served. Once again, the bread bore silent
witness to their status. One manual suggests three trenchers for the
master
of the household, two for his son, and one for the least distinguished
at the table. Another, more lavish, proposes four for the lord, <i>'and
soo iii or ii after her (their) degree.'</i></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"To prepare a trencher for
someone else was a courtesy. In the
      <i>Holkham
Bible Picture Book</i>, Jesus may be seen, as a young boy, cutting
bread
for Mary and Joseph. A person sufficiently distinguished to receive
several
trenchers would find them presented to him on the blade of the server's
knife and then ranged before him, sometimes side by side or in a
square,
sometimes in a little pile. One might be set out on its own to act as a
personal saltcellar.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"If at no other stage in a
meal, a clean trencher was expected at
the very end, when cheese and little delicacies were brought in. The
child
addressed in <i>The Babees Book</i> is given this advice:</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>'Whanne chese ys brouhte, A
trenchoure ha (have) ye clene On whiche
withe clene knyf ye your chese mowe kerve.'</i></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"From these 'dessert'
trenchers developed miniature wooden plates,
charmingly decorated on one side with flowers and improving texts, of
which
a few sixteenth and seventeenth examples still survive."</b>
