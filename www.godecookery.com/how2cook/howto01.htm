      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Vegetables were eaten daily in
the Middle Ages &amp; Renaissance,
but, like today, were in many ways considered an inferior or secondary
menu item; vegetable dishes are hardly ever mentioned in Medieval
cookbooks.
Victorian &amp; early-20th century food historians seized on this fact
as proof that vegetables were hardly ever eaten, but this was an
erroneous
assumption which fortunately is not given much credence today. The fact
is that the use of vegetables was wide-spread and prolific, and
vegetables
were an important food item in the diet of nearly all Medieval people.
The pure simplicity of vegetable preparation often meant that precious
vellum or parchment wasn't wasted on recording the recipes; some
cookbooks
go so far as to point out that the ability to prepare vegetables is
common
knowledge and further instructions are not necessary.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A good example of the attitude
toward vegetables is seen in the prevalent
period response to onions, a staple of Medieval cooking. Onions were
considered
lower-class &amp; peasant fare, an ingredient to be used for the
meanest
of meals only, and a food that should be disdained by the upper
classes.
Eating onions was also said to be bad for one's complexion or humour;
the
pallid countenance, waxy hair, and ill-manners of Chaucer's <i>Summoner</i>
is blamed on his diet of onions and garlic. Still, no matter how people
may have turned up their noses to the idea of eating onions, they ate
them
in great numbers anyway. Nearly every garden plot grew onions and they
are mentioned in all of the existing Medieval cookbooks.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>In the Medieval era, the
differences between vegetables, herbs, and
any plant used in cooking was less distinct than today. All of the
various
available vegetables were frequently lumped together under the term <i>"potherb,"</i>
which also included edible flowers such as violets and primroses and
herbs
such as fennel and rue. Judging by the significant usage of the word <i>"potherb"</i>
in Medieval times, vegetables and other plants played a major role in
everyday
meals, enough that their absence would've resulted in a considerable
loss
of nutrition and vitamins.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Wortes</i> was another
common expression for certain vegetables,
and included all leafy edible plants. <i>Wortes</i> were generally
herb-plants
such as parsley, but also included cabbage, spinach, and even onions
&amp;
leeks.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The modern salad, with raw
lettuce &amp; vegetables tossed in oil
and vinegar, is one of the most popular ways of eating vegetables
today,
and that was true in Medieval cookery as well. Many period cookbooks
instruct
vegetables to be served raw, by themselves or with vinegar, oil, and
salt.
And also like today, this way of serving vegetables was considered an
excellent
way to begin a meal. Platina wrote in <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"What should be eaten
first. There is an order to be observed
in taking food, since everything that moves the bowels and whatever is
of light and slight nourishment, like apples and pears, is more safely
and pleasantly eaten in the first course. I even add lettuce and
whatever
is served with vinegar and oil, raw or cooked." </i><font size="-1">-

Scully, <i>The Art of Cookery in the Middle Ages.</i></font></b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Le Menagier de Paris</i> (a
14th century home manual written by
an elderly bridegroom), in giving planting instructions to the
Menagier's
young bride, mentions many different flowers, vegetables, herbs, and
fruits
that are to be contained within their domestic garden. The list of
vegetables
features beet, leek, cabbage, parsley, bean, pea, spinach, lettuce,
pumpkin,
turnip, radish, &amp; parsnip. In addition are other vegetables that
the
Menagier includes in his cooking instructions, which were purchased and
not grown: carrots (which were specifically mentioned as being acquired
in the market), shallots, cress, &amp; garlic. The Menagier's recipes
for
vegetables are typical of the time period: simple and not nearly as
numerous
as his instructions for preparing meat and fish.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Terence Scully, in his book <i>The
Art of Cookery in the Middle Ages</i>,
has this to say about the preparation of vegetables:</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"Most vegetables, whether
leaves or roots, were chopped, ground
and cooked by boiling. The logic of this cooking method lay in the
tendency
of vegetables, being products of the earth, to be dry in their nature
(the
exceptions being vegetable marrows, melons, &amp; chard, all three of
which
were held to be rather moist); the action of stewing vegetables lent
them
the moisture they lacked by their nature. Members of the onion family,
however, being moist in the third, and even fourth - or most dangerous
(even mortal) - degree, were usually fried, thus removing a little of
their
superfluous moisture."</i></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The 14th century French
cookbook <i>Le Viandier de Taillevant</i>
says this:</b>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"154. D'autres menuz
potaiges...: Other Lesser Pottages, such
as stewed chard, cabbage, turnip greens, leeks, veal in Yellow Sauce,
and
plain shallot pottage, peas, frenched beans, mashed beans, sieved beans
or beans in their shell, pork offal, brewet of pork tripe -- women are
experts with these and anyone knows how to do them."</i></b></div>
