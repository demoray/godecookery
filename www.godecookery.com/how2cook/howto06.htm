      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Christmas conjures up images
of a host of culinary delights and treats
to modern man; as one of the most festive occasions in the contemporary
calendar, the season is marked by indulgences in food and diet that
normally
would be restricted or frowned upon during other parts of the year.
This
is further punctuated by a celebratory attitude that at this time
permits
(and even encourages) a relaxation of one's usual mode of eating and
simply
allows nearly everything that is desirable and tasty! It is a time of
eating,
of feasting, of sharing repasts with friends and neighbors, and of
gaining
the ubiquitous Christmas pounds!</b> </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Such festivity was true in
medieval times as well, though there are
striking differences in what was eaten and served at Christmas time
then
as compared to now. Simply put, there were not as many
Christmas-specific
foods as there are now; mankind feasted heartily, but on foods and
recipes
that also were available and popular during the rest of the year -
these
were produced in finer quality and eaten in greater amounts at this
time,
but there was not a specific and detailed menu on what should or should
not be eaten at Christmas. Much of the festivity that revolved around
food
seemed to be not in <i>what</i> was being offered, but in how it was
offered,
the quantities that were available, and in the act of sharing a meal
and
eating together. Several dishes of healthy, tasty food and ale to last
a day, along with fuel for cooking and warmth, and candles to light the
long evening, was an honored and acceptable gift from the lord to his
villeins.
In some recorded cases, the gift of food for the day was as simple as a
loaf of bread, ale to drink, and some firewood. Many lords would invite
their workers and serfs to the manor for Christmas dinner; in most
cases,
though, the food, serving utensils, and even the fuel for cooking were
usually provided by the villeins themselves. It seems the real spirit
of
the moment was seen in the communal exchange of food and the enjoyment
of feasting with friends in front of the burning <i>Yule Log</i> of
the
lord's hearth.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There are <i>some</i> food
rules to remember when composing an authentic </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
feast; as the days leading up to Christmas were the fast, or
fish-days
of Advent, fish was eaten in great quantities up to and including
Christmas
Eve. (This, therefore, usually meant that fish was not considered an
appropriate
food for the post-Advent Christmas period; one would be considered a
poor
or offensive host to offer fish for a Christmas meal!) The practice of
serving fish up until Christmas Day survives enthusiastically today as
the modern Italian-American tradition of a large and extravagant
Christmas
Eve seafood dinner.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>And there <i>were</i> a few
foods did became associated with Christmas
at this time: the Boar's Head, which still today holds great
connotations
of Yule, and Plum Pudding &amp; Mincemeat Pie, two treats also
contemporarily
linked with the holiday. However, these foods were also quite common
during
the rest of the year; the Boar's Head was found at many great dinners,
being considered an honored dish at all times. Plum Pudding would have
been eaten whenever economy and season dictated. And Mincemeat Pie
(made
with real meat) was simply yet another </b><b>m</b><b>edieval-style
meat pie with a
heavy
dried fruit base. Still, the </b><b>m</b><b>edieval population found
these dishes
particularly
appealing at Christmas, and the Boar's Head was considered so standard
that if a real one could not be acquired, a faux presentation made of
cake
or other foods was more than acceptable.</b><b><br>
      </b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>By </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
times, the game
of the Bean King or Mock King was old
enough to be considered "ancient." This was a cake or a loaf of bread
which
had hidden in it a small object, such as a bean. Whoever found the bean
in their portion was proclaimed the Bean King, and presided as a
humorous
ruler over the Christmas festivities. In some cultures the Bean cake
was
shaped like a crown and was associated with the Three Wise Kings.</b></p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">---------- A Christmas Eve dinner and A
Christmas Day
dinner ----------</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Advent fast, prohibiting
meat, chicken, milk, cheese, butter,
etc. (i.e., virtually all animal products), and lasting a time period
that
included the four Sundays preceding Yule, was THE primary motivation
for
the festal consumption of food during a </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
Christmas. This simple
fact should always be kept in mind when planning a </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
feast in an
authentic manner. Christmas itself ran from Christmas Day up through
Epiphany,
or Twelfth Day (January 6). The rules and standards of food at
Christmas
time lasted for this entire 12 day period.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A Christmas Eve dinner should
be composed of </b><b>m</b><b>edieval dishes that
are for fish-days, fast-days, Ember days, and for Lent. (Ember Days
were
four significant fast-days held during Lent, just after Pentecost,
September,
and in December during Advent.) These sorts of recipes are usually
clearly
denoted in </b><b>m</b><b>edieval cooking manuscripts, and can be
found throughout
the
recipe sections of <a
 href="http://www.godecookery.com/allrec/allrec.htm">Gode Cookery</a>.
Exotic and varied viands of fish &amp;
seafood
should dominate: grilled, fried, roasted, baked fish, etc. with a
variety
of sauces; oysters, mussels, crabs, lobster, clams, and assorted
shellfish
(such as periwinkles) are very acceptable and can be prepared in a
multitude
of ways. <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/goderec/grec31.htm">Almond
milk</a> should be the ingredient used for sauces, as it was the main
substitute
for milk during a fast. Fried foods are prepared in olive &amp; nut
oils (see: <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/how2cook/howto03.htm">Oils</a>)
rather than animal fats.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Medieval cooks came up with a
variety of ways to circumvent the restrictions
of a fast-day: mock cheese was made out of fish and almond milk, fish
was
made to taste like meat, etc. And some people relied on extremes in
common
food beliefs to see them through their fast: beaver tail (a high source
of fat &amp; protein) was acceptable as the beaver lived in water, like
a fish; ordinary geese were often identified as being the mythical <a
 href="http://www.godecookery.com/mythical/mythic01.htm">Barnacle
Goose</a> by both sellers and consumers alike. The Barnacle Goose,
being
a product of the ocean, was not a true land-goose and therefore was not
restricted. Therefore, if the cook or host of a Christmas Eve dinner
wishes
to serve goose, it may be done so, but only in the honest faith that it
is a true Barnacle Goose that is being served! (Imagine a platter of
Barnacle
Goose surrounded by oysters, mussels, clams, etc. Yum!)</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bread, cheese, ale, &amp; wine
should be included with the foods
of both a Christmas Eve or a Christmas Day dinner.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
Christmas Day
dinner could be composed of rich and extravagant
dishes, heavy with meat and sweets, and laden with delicacies and
treats;
or, an equally authentic way to eat would be to have simple but hearty
dishes like stewed chicken or beef, or pork, ham or bacon served with
mustard,
along with cheese, bread and ale. The choice is yours, as was our </b><b>m</b><b>edieval
predecessors. Certainly, the Boar's Head should be included in any
large
dinner or party, whether real or made of cake, as well as Plum Pudding,
Mincemeat Pie, and such treats as gingerbread, spiced wines, etc.
Venison
was a popular meat at Christmas, and possibly represented about 1/4 of
all meat eaten at that time, according to household records. Goose,
duck,
hen, and an enormous range of fowl &amp; poultry served in or with a
variety
of sauces; dishes of beef, pork, &amp; rabbit prepared in numerous
ways;
rich soups and thick pottages and stews; a plethora of sweets and
desserts
- the list of acceptable foods that are authentic, delectable, and
highly
appropriate for a Christmas Feast would be a long one! Any documented,
authentic recipe found in <a
 href="http://www.godecookery.com/allrec/allrec.htm">A
Boke of Gode Cookery</a> which is not intended as a fast-day item would
be more than suitable.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>And don't forget about the
Bean Cake! More about it <a href="#beanking">HERE</a>.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Decorating the home with
greenery during the holiday has been a custom
since the Roman festival of Saturnalia, and has been documented as
having
occurred in London as early as the 12th century. The Medieval dinner
table

just
like today.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Singing carols at a Christmas

      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><b>The two
longest and most important fasts were Advent and
Lent, which
ushered in the greatest feasts of the years, Christmas &amp; Easter.
The
season of Advent covers a span of about four weeks and always contains
four Sundays. It begins on the first of these, Advent Sunday, and this
day marks the start of the ecclesiastical year. It is a period of
preparation
for Christmas, a time when man tries to turn over a new leaf and start
again. One fifteenth-century sermon writer points the parallel between
the Church and the individual: just as the Church makes a fresh
beginning
on Advent Sunday, '<i>so owe ye to begynne and renewe youre lfyy.'<br>
      </i><br>
The form
of a fast varied very much from occasion to
occasion. Indeed,
the term fast scarcely applies to an ordinary Friday, for an ordinary
layman.
The amount eaten could be just as ample as usual, and the only change
expected
was a change in the main ingredient of the menu, from meat to fish.<br>
      <br>
In the
fourteenth -century romance <i>Sir Gawain and the
Green Knight</i>,
the hero arrives at a castle on Christmas Eve, the last day of the
Advent
fast. Officially, therefore, the dinner must be meatless; nevertheless,
the cooks have contrived a dazzling prelude to the Christmas
festivities,
working their inspired variations on the theme of fish: fish baked,
fish
grilled, fish simmered, fish attended by a hundred subtle sauces. The
host's
apologies for <i>'this penaunce'</i> are mere polite pretense, the
modesty
becoming a winner. Fast has been triumphantly metamorphosed into feast.<br>
      <br>
Christmas
was the very epitome of exuberant
self-indulgence. Its various
names were synonyms of the good life. Henryson's two mice, reveling in
the larder, toast their luck with the shout: <i>'Haill, Yule! Haill!'</i>
(Yule used here with the meaning <i>'time of merrymaking.'<br>
      </i><br>
Christmas
Day and the week that followed were given over
to enjoyment;
as one fifteenth-century sermon writer simply summed up the matter: <i>'...
in Christmasse wyke ...then there is no tyme to faste.'</i> In Ben
Jonson's <i>Masque
of Christmas</i> (1616), one character says to Christmas: <i>'Here's
one
o' Friday Street would come in,'</i> and Christmas replies: <i>'By no
means,
nor out of neither of the Fish Streets admit not a man; they are not
Christmas
creatures; fish and fasting days, foh!'<br>
      </i><br>
In a
contract drawn up for masons and carpenters in
Calais, in 1474,
feast days were graded according to their importance; the time at which
work finished depended on the dignity of the day. Thus a minor feast,
like
New Year's Day, was not recognized as a holiday and work ended at the
usual
time, that is, five in the afternoon. On a more important feast, like
St.
Thomas of Canterbury's, work stopped at three in the afternoon, while
on
the greatest of all, like Christmas itself, tools were downed at eleven
in the morning. Although this particular group of men was expected to
work
a few hours even on Christmas Day, it was the general custom to take a
holiday lasting several days in the Christmas week. At York in 1327,
all
work stopped from 24 December until the twenty-eighth, and at
Westminster
in 1331, the vacation lasted from 23 December to the thirtieth.<br>
      <br>
In his
journal, William More, the last Prior of Worcester,
wrote down
the expenses for his abbey's annual Christmas feast, given to a mixed
company
of clergy and city officials. Year after year he noted payments to
minstrels,
entertainers, and carolers: <i>'1518: Item to syngers of carralls
14d./8d./8d...
1520: Item rewards for caralls on Christmas day dynar 14d./ at supper
8d...
1527: Item for syngyng of carralls on cristmas day and to mynstrells
2s.
6d. 16d.'</i> During Henry VII's Twelfth Night feast in 1487, <i>'at
the
Table in the Medell of the Hall sat the Deane and those of the Kings
Chapell,
which incontynently [straightaway] after the Kings furst Course sange a
Carall.'<br>
      </i><br>
Wild boar
was often the star attraction of a Christmas
feast, and the
head was brought in to the sounds of its own special songs, ranging
from
the merely cheerful to brisk reminders of the season's doctrinal
significance:<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><b>Feastdays
in the late autumn and at the end of the year
tended traditionally
to see the serving of the meats of domestic animals and fowl that were
difficult or costly to maintain over the winter months. Pork and goose
became associated with Christmas meals. Wild pigs could be captured
right
across Europe and the Christmastide boar's head marked both the end of
the hunting season and the time of courageous renewal in the Christian
year.<br>
      <br>
St.
Nicolas, the patron saint of children, was always
perceived as a
figure of generosity: for example, so that all girls might have an
appropriate
dowry to bring to a marriage, he used to distribute purses of gold
coins
to the homes of the poor. On (and about) December 6 households would
serve
up all the fresh fruits of the season, both local and exotic, along
with
the candies, nuts, sweetmeats, spiced cakes and other delicacies that
St.
Nicolas was supposed to have brought. Marzipan and various gingerbreads
hence became widely connected with the Christmas season.</b><b><br>
      <br>
The prevalence of fruits at this time and the predilection they enjoyed
lead to the incorporation of the sweeter varieties, especially figs,
dates
and raisins, into a mixture with sugar, spices and bland meats. This <i>'mincemeat'</i>
was merely an appetizing variety of dish whose basis was the ubiquitous
groundmeat paste, but it, too, came to mark the Christmas season. Plum
pudding was likewise a dish that became firmly established in the food
habits of this time of year. Some cakes had a rich variety of fresh
chopped
fruits worked into their batter.</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
A major fast of the year, that preceding Christmas Day, was usually
marked
by a preparation of the more valued sea-foods: whitefish, sturgeon, eel
and oysters. Even today finely sliced salmon and oysters remain
favorite
foods of this season. The feastday of St. John the Evangelist (December
27) was associated with wine because a legend held that by blessing a
glass
of wine that saint rendered the poison in it harmless.<br>
      <br>
      </span><b><a name="beanking"></a>Since the Feast of the Epiphany
(January 6) commemorated
the visit of the Wise Men or Magi (kings) to the Christ child, it
became
universally customary to prepare a cake in the shape of a royal crown
for
this celebration. Originally in antique times a mere wreath to
symbolize
power and victory, the crown had come as well to symbolize purity and
consecration.
As a food, the many versions of the <i>'King's Cake'</i> testify to
the
broad popularity of this cake at this time in the ecclesiastical
calendar.
Certain traditions, involving the hiding of small articles in this
cake,
grew with its use: if a person eating it found a pea or bean in his
piece,
he was declared the 'king' or ruler over the Epiphany festivities;
finding
a ring presaged marriage in the coming year for the finder; finding a
coin,
wealth.</b></div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><b>Tenants
on a manor belonging to St. Paul's cathedral,
London, were bound
to watch at the manor house from Christmas to Twelfth Day, their pay <i>'a
good fire in the hall, one white loaf, one cooked dish , and a gallon
of
ale [per day].'<br>
      </i><br>
Tenants
on the manors owed special rents but also enjoyed
special privileges.
Usually they owed the lord bread, hens, and ale, which they brewed
themselves,
while in return he gave them Christmas dinner, consisting mainly of the
food they had provided; the lord thus organized Christmas dinner at
little
cost to himself, the tenants often even providing their own fuel,
dishes,
and napkins. A group of three prosperous villeins on a manor belonging
to Wells Cathedral in the early fourteenth century received <i>'two
white
loaves, as much beer as they will drink in a day, a mess of beef and of
bacon with mustard, one of browis (stew) of hen, and a cheese, fuel to
cook their food... and to burn from dinner time till even and
afterwards,
and two candles.'</i> Another villein who held less land was to have
Christmas
dinner, <i>'but he must bring with him... his own cloth, cup and
trencher,
and take away all that is left on his cloth, and he shall have for
himself
and his neighbours one wastel [loaf] cut in three for the ancient
Christmas
game to be played with the said wastel.'</i> The <i>'ancient Christmas
game'</i> may have been a version of <i>'king of the bean,'</i> in
which
a bean was hidden in a cake or loaf, and the person who found it became
king of the feast. Many of the manors of Glastonbury Abbey gave
Christmas
feasts in the manor hall to which the tenant brought firewood and his
own
dish, mug, and napkin <i>'if he wanted to eat off a cloth.'</i> Bread,
broth, and beer were served, and two kinds of meat, and the villeins
were
entitled to sit drinking after dinner in the manor hall.<br>

a Christmas meal was provided for a villein, for

one of the lord's shepherds. In one case it was recorded that a man

sometimes grain which was brewed into ale. At Christmas also the lord
was
expected to give his tenants a meal, for example bread, cheese, pottage
and two dishes of meat. The tenant might be directed to bring his own
plate,
mug and napkin if he wished there to be a cloth on the table, and a
faggot
of brushwood to cook his food, unless he wished to have it raw.
Sometimes
the custom said explicitly that the lord had to give a Christmas meal
because
the tenant had given him the food. In at least one instance the value
of
the food to be provided by the lord was to be the same value as that
given
by the tenant. The role of the lord in this case appears to have merely
to organize the village Christmas dinner.<br>
      <br>
According
to the household records of the thirteenth
century Bishop
of Winchester, almonds and raisins were bought at Christmas, perhaps
for
a Christmas pudding. Apart from this there is no sign that they
celebrated
Christmas by eating anything very different from their normal diet.<br>
      <br>
In 1289
Richard de Swinfield, the Bishop of Hereford,
spent Christmas
at his manor of Prestbury, near Glouscester. The day before Christmas
was
kept as a fast, but a considerable amount of fish, herrings, conger
eels
and codlings were eaten, together with a salmon costing 5s. 8d (28p,
quite
a high price). A dozen cups, 300 dishes, 150 large plates and 200 small
plates were obtained for the occasion. There were a number of guests -
at least fifteen judging by the number of extra horses in the stable
for
the next two days. On the following day (Christmas Day) even more food
was consumed. Over three days they ate no less than 1 boar, 2 complete
carcasses and 3 quarters of beef, 2 calves, 4 doves, 4 pigs, about 60
fowl
(hens or possibly capons), 8 partridges and 2 geese, as well as bread
and
cheese. The amount of ale served was not recorded, but ten sextaries
(about
10 pints) of red wine and one of white were consumed. This is a modest
amount for about 70 people.<br>
