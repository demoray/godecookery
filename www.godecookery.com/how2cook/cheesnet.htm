of Cheese</font></b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Most authorities consider that
cheese was first made in the Middle
East. The earliest type was a form of sour milk which came into being
when
it was discovered that domesticated animals could be milked. A
legendary
story has it that cheese was 'discovered' by an unknown Arab nomad. He
is said to have filled a saddlebag with milk to sustain him on a
journey
across the desert by horse. After several hours riding he stopped to
quench
his thirst, only to find that the milk had separated into a pale watery
liquid and solid white lumps. Because the saddlebag, which was made
from
the stomach of a young animal, contained a coagulating enzyme known as
rennin, the milk had been effectively separated into curds and whey by
the combination of the rennin, the hot sun and the galloping motions of
the horse. The nomad, unconcerned with technical details, found the
whey
drinkable and the curds edible.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cheese was known to the
ancient Sumerians four thousand years before
the birth of Christ. The ancient Greeks credited Aristaeus, a son of
Apollo
and Cyrene, with its discovery; it is mentioned in the Old Testament.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>In the Roman era cheese really
came into its own. Cheesemaking was
done with skill and knowledge and reached a high standard. By this time
the ripening process had been developed and it was known that various
treatments
and conditions under storage resulted in different flavours and
characteristics.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The larger Roman houses had a
separate cheese kitchen, the caseale,
and also special areas where cheese could be matured. In large towns
home-made
cheese could be taken to a special centre to be smoked. Cheese was
served
on the tables of the nobility and traveled to the far corners of the
Roman
Empire as a regular part of the rations of the legions.</b> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>During the Middle Ages,
monks became innovators and developers and
it is to them we owe many of the classic varieties of cheese marketed
today.
During the Renaissance period cheese suffered a drop in popularity,
being
considered unhealthy, but it regained favour by the nineteenth century,
the period that saw the start of the move from farm to factory
production.<br>
