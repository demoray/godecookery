"In whatever category of foodstuffs contemporary students of natural
science felt inclined to place nuts, it must be observed that they
played
an enormous role in the medieval diet. Walnuts, filberts (hazelnuts),
pistachios,
chestnuts, pine-nuts and almonds were kept on hand in the larger
kitchens.
Almonds, in particular, seem to constitute the <i>sine qua non</i> of
medieval
cookery: there is perhaps no one common ingredient in the dishes of the
day than almonds, in one form or the other. Usually ground very finely
in a mortar, mixed with a liquid and then strained, almonds yielded a
so-called
almond milk whose culinary uses appear to be close to infinite in
number."</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nuts were considered an
important part of the medieval menu due to
their naturally dry properties. Physicians recommended that when fish
was
served it was to be immediately followed by nuts, as their dry humour
would
absorb &amp; balance the moisture found overly abundant in most fish.</b></div>
      <p></p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Nuts, along with candies,
sweetmeat, &amp; spiced cakes, were among
the delicacies St. Nicholas brought with him at Christmas time.</b></div>

      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Acorns</font>
- health manuals recommended eating acorns
roasted and with sugar to prevent menstruation and to aid in retention;
however, their actual use was primarily in feeding pigs and other
domesticated
animals. See illustration of: <i><a
 href="../afeast/animals/ani033.html">Feeding
acorns to pigs</a></i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Almonds</font>
- most common of all nuts in the Middle
Ages; almonds were grown all over England and were used lavishly in
cooking.
See illustrations of: <a href="../afeast/foods/food025.html">Bitter
Almonds</a>
and <a href="../afeast/foods/food034.html">Almonds</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Almond Milk</font>
- standard medieval sauce, found
extensively throughout period cooking resources. See; <a
 href="../goderec/grec31.htm">Almond
Milk</a>; <a href="../mtrans/mtrans54.html">Botere of almand melk</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Chestnuts</font>
- see illustration of: <a href="../afeast/foods/food031.html">Chestnuts</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Filberts</font>
- used as a nut or made into oil. See:
      <a href="howto03.htm">Oils</a>.
Filberts candied in sugar were considered a fine confection.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Marzipan,
Marchepane</font> - A paste made from ground
almonds &amp; sugar, often used for creating subtleties and
3-dimensional
displays. See: <a href="../friends/frec51.htm">Marchpane</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Pine Nuts</font>
- like almonds, used extensively in
medieval cooking.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Pistachios</font>
- a favorite in desserts and sweets;
candied pistachios were popular and they were often incorporated into
marzipan,
along with almonds.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="+1">Walnuts</font>
- used as a nut or made into oil. See:
      <a href="howto03.htm">Oils</a>.

confections.</b></p>
