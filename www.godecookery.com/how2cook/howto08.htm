      <p><b><font size="+1">The Medieval Wedding</font></b> <br>
      <b>by Jill Kimble</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Jill Kimble has written an
informative article on
presenting a medieval wedding, the text of which appears here. A Boke
of
Gode Cookery is honored that she chose to recommend the recipes from
this
site for use in the wedding feast.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Jill Kimble's article was
originally found on Wedserv.com.</b><b><br>
      </b></p>
      <p><b><u><font size="+2">The Medieval Wedding</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Have you always been
fascinated by Lady Guinevere or the Knights
of the Round Table? Would being transported back to Robin Hood's day be
an ultimate fantasy of yours? If you spent many a night as a child
wondering
what life back then would have been like, perhaps you should consider
transforming
one of the most important days of your life into a mystical, romantic
adventure:
your wedding day.</b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b><u><font size="+1">Location</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Medieval weddings are
generally held outdoors or in a traditional
church if properly decorated with banners, heavy wooden chairs,
grapevine
wreaths on the doors, English ivy, Medieval banners, votive candles set
in gold holders, and white flowers.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>If you want your ceremony in a
church, try to find one that looks
Gothic--made of stone, with lots of stained glass, and possibly some
Tudor
(brown and ivory) wooden accents.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>For an outdoor wedding,
decorate the space with plenty of ivy, which
is the traditional wedding plant of the era, black iron candelabras and
scrolls, banners of family crests, large baskets of flowers, and
flowered
garlands on wooden and/or iron poles. Big, chunky wooden candleholders
are also appropriate and add the requisite flavor to the scene.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Another location option is
to get married at a local or regional
Renaissance Fair. In the United States, nearly every state or even
counties
hold such a fair, and it is becoming more common to see weddings taking
place at them. Usually a hospitality coordinator is in charge of
arranging
such an event, and then most all of the hard work is done for you.
Often,
the wedding parties just show up, and the fair takes care of the rest.
The feasibility of this option, however, depends on both the size of
the
fair and the size of the wedding; it is much easier to have your
wedding
at the fair if you are having a smaller ceremony.</b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b><u><font size="+1">Clothing</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The bride must remember that
brides in the medieval era wore dark
and regal velvet dresses in such colors as hunter green, burgundy wine
or deep purple. Often these dresses were laced up the sides and/or
back,
with long pleated floor-length skirts, and were long-sleeved. They were
also relatively, but tastefully, low-cut. A gold or silver metallic
ribbon
often ran throughout the design. (For an example, check out <font
 size="+1"><a href="http://www.fairyfashion.de/frame.html">Fairy
Fashion</a></font>, click on Wedding Gowns, scroll down and click on
the
"Lady Jolene" dress.)</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Brides today who want a
medieval or Renaissance-style wedding should
stick to such a dress for both themselves and their bridesmaids. Their
hair should be worn long and flowing, with loose curls. In lieu of a
veil,
brides should wear a golden circlet or a wreath of ivy, herbs, and
flowers,
possibly with ribbons attached and hanging loosely over the back of her
head.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The dress is as unique for
men. Tights, breeches, tunics, pirate
shirts, laced vests, and boots are the order of the day. (Visit check
out <font size="+1"><a href="http://www.fairyfashion.de/frame.html">Fairy
Fashion</a></font> and click Men's Attire.) If the groom or his
groomsmen
have long hair, they should also wear it loose.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Finding this style of
clothing is not as hard as you might think.
Two basic options exist for those trying to outfit an entire group of
Medieval
revelers: you could either rent these costumes from a rental
establishment
or buy them. Look in your yellow pages to find costume shops in your
area.
They might even offer a discount for a large group. In addition to
Fairy
Fashion, you can also check out <font size="+1"><a
 href="http://www.by-the-sword.com/clothes.html">By
the Sword</a></font> to start looking into your options for purchasing
clothing and what you might have to spend to look authentic.<br>
      <br>
(Gode Cookery also recommends <big><a
 href="http://www.historicenterprises.com/">Historic Enterprises</a></big>
for the most beautiful &amp; finest authentic clothing available.)<br>
      </b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b><u><font size="+1">Flowers</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The element that makes the
flowers of this celebration distinct from
other weddings is the prominent use of herbs. Rosemary, thyme, basil
and
even garlic often play a prominent role and are interspersed with the
chosen
flowers. This custom originated from what was then believed to be the
mystical,
even religious, significance of various herbs in both health and
destiny.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>As with the clothing, the
flowers displayed should be rich, darker
shades such as red, orange, purple, green, brown and bright yellow.
Suggested
flowers include:</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Gloriosa Lily, which has
the appearance of crushed red velvet;
Ivy; Red Roses; Amaryllis; Birch Twigs or Holly Branches; and Parrot
Tulips.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bouquets, especially the
bride's, should be large, overflowing and
hand tied. A must for any bridal bouquet is to include a small amount
of
wheat as a symbol of fertility. Because you are trying to reproduce a
time
long before the era of professional flower shops and Styrofoam, all the
flowers should appear as rustic and natural as possible.</b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b><u><font size="+1">Ceremony</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The music for the ceremony
should be that of a pipe organ, flute,
harp or lute. Even though centuries separates us from the Middle Ages,
the wedding ceremony itself remains much the same, with only one major
difference: the ceremony took place outside the church door before
entering
the church for a nuptial mass.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>During the ceremony, as in
today, the man stood on the right side
and the woman stood on the left, facing the door of the church because
she was formed out of a rib in the left side of Adam. The priest begins
by asking if anyone knows of any reason the couple should not be
married.
He also asks this of the man and woman so they may confess any reasons
for prohibiting their marriage.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The wording of the ceremony is
slightly different as well. The ceremony
would proceed with the priest saying, "(Groom's name), wilt thou have
this
woman to be thy wedded wife, wilt thou love her, and honor her, keep
her
and guard her, in health and in sickness, as a husband should a wife,
and
forsaking all others on account of her, keep thee only unto her, so
long
as ye both shall live?" Then the priest asks the same of the woman.
Both
the man and the woman should answer by saying "I will." At this time
the
woman is given by her father.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The wedding continues with the
saying of vows. Both the man and the
woman say, "I, (name), take thee, (name) to be my wedded wife/husband,
to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for
richer,
for poorer, in sickness, and in health, till death do us part, if the
holy
church will ordain it: And thereto I plight thee my troth."</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The tradition of exchanging
rings also comes to us from this time
period: the rings are given to the priest to bless them. He gives them
back, and the bride and groom exchange rings. They bow their heads, and
the priest gives them a blessing.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Because the couple was outside
the church, now the husband and wife
would enter the church, where they knelt before the altar. At the altar
the priest would give a prayer and a blessing, thus ending the marriage
ceremony.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>An added touch would be to
have the bride and groom escorted to and
from the ceremony by a horse-drawn carriage.</b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b><u><font size="+1">Reception</font></u></b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Decorate the reception hall as
you did the church or outside location.
Remember to keep your decorations as natural and rustic as possible.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>If you want to replicate the <font
 size="+1"><a href="http://www.godecookery.com/gcooktoc/gcooktoc.htm">medieval
feast</a></font>, keep in mind that they were served in courses and
each
course was like a meal in itself. People ate with their hands, a spoon
and a small knife the size of a steak knife. Forks were not used by the
majority of people; instead, only royalty and the very wealthy would
use
them.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>These recipes have been
modernized for easy preparation. The traditional
drink of a medieval wedding was <font size="+1"><a
 href="http://www.godecookery.com/begrec/begrec24.htm">honeymead</a></font>.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>In addition, there was
entertainment during and between the courses.
You might consider hiring several jugglers or acrobats to perform
during
the meal; in costume, they will easily transport your guests to a
different
time. You could also hire a medieval entertainment group to include
lively entertainment for your guests.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>You might want to include a
castle or knight with a horse as your
cake topper. When cutting the cake, you could use a sword, and toast
each
other with pewter goblets.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Whether you want to recreate
an entire medieval wedding or incorporate
only a few elements of the theme into your ceremony and reception, your
special day will be enchanting and one you and your guests will
remember
for ages to come.</b></div>
