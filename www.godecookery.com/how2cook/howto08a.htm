      <p><b><font color="#800000">The Wedding Feast of Ammabelle and
Rhuadhagan,
June 5, 1993</font></b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>For this wedding, the bride
and groom were both medieval enthusiasts,
but wanted food that their non-medieval friends and family would
appreciate.
The menu was therefore a mixture of authentic, semi-authentic, and
modern
foods, with hearts and cherubs as a motif. The bride herself chose many
of the items, including most of the hors d'ouvres and the subtleties
(the
desserts). The bride also made a beautiful wedding cake decorated with
fresh flowers; champagne &amp; wine were served throughout the dinner.</b></p>

positioned against the oval to be the long neck and head. The top part
of the oval loaf was cut lengthwise to make wings. The body was filled
with strawberries in a sugar sauce and the wings were placed on top so
that it appeared that the swan had its wings open. A beak was made from
a quartered-lemon peel and held in place on the "head" with large
cloves.
The entire bird was decorated with "feathers" made by piping on white
icing
in decorative patterns &amp; swirls.</b></li>
