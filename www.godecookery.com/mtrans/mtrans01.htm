<p><b><font size=-1>INGREDIENTS:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Whole rabbit - it may be easier to obtain this in pieces, but the original
recipe calls for whole rabbit; however, since the rabbit is cut into pieces
early on in the recipe, there really should be no difference in the final
product if whole or pieced rabbit is used at the beginning.</b></li>

<li>
<b><a href="../goderec/grec15.htm">Gode Broth</a> - the term "good broth"
really was generic and implied the use of any decent broth that happened
to be on hand. You may use <a href="../goderec/grec15.htm">our recipe</a>,
or any other that you prefer.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Wine - Greek wine was a sweet wine that actually came from Italy, so
any sweet, Italian-style wine will do for this.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Vinegar - red wine vinegar may be the most appropriate.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Spices: cinnamon, whole cloves, whole cubebs, and any other period spice
which you prefer.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Currants</b></li>

<li>
<b>Fresh ginger root, minced</b></li>
</ul>
<b><font size=-1>DIRECTIONS:</font></b>
<p><b>Boil the rabbit in broth until just done (do not overcook). Remove
from broth and let cool. (Save the broth for later use.) Cut the rabbit
into serving-size pieces. In a large pot, combine the wine, vinegar, spices,
currants, &amp; ginger; bring to a boil. Add the rabbit pieces and return
to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to cook for several more minutes, until
the currants have plumped and the ginger has become tender. Remove the
rabbit; place the meat in a serving dish and cover with the sauce &amp;
currants. Serve it forth!</b>
<p><b>This sauce should be "poynaunt" like many similar medieval sauces
- in other words, a sort of sweet and sour. The sweet will be coming from
the wine and the juice released by currants as they cook, so be sure that
the amount of sour vinegar you add is not overwhelming and that the tartness
matches the sweetness. The fresh ginger will also impart a nice fiery bite,
so be careful of the amount used.</b>
<p><b>Note: substitute chicken for rabbit and make this dish "Checonys
in Cyrip."</b>
