<p><b><font size=-1>INGREDIENTS:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 swan (see note)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Olive oil (see note)</b></li>
</ul>
<b><font size=-1>DIRECTIONS:</font></b>
<p><b>With your hands or a pastry brush, coat the entire outside of a cleaned
&amp; gutted swan (being sure to reserve the giblets for the Chaudon sauce)
with olive oil. Roast on either a spit or in an oven. (A modern rotisserie
may be the closest many of us will be able to come to actual spit roasting,
but if that is not possible, an oven will do the job as well.) Roast until
done, basting often with broth or drippings. Carve into serving pieces
and serve with Chaudon sauce.</b>
<p><b>Chaudon Sauce:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Swan giblets</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>Broth</b></li>

<li>
<b>Unseasoned toasted breadcrumbs (see note)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Ginger</b></li>

<li>
<b>Galingale</b></li>

<li>
<b>Red Wine Vinegar</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Wash the blood from the giblets, and while still wet, sprinkle with
a little salt. Place in a pot, cover with water and boil until done. Remove,
drain, &amp; cool. Chop the giblets into small pieces; place giblets and
the broth, spices, &amp; breadcrumbs in a food processor (or any equivalent
device) and combine into a smooth gravy-like sauce. Strain if necessary.
Place in a sauceboat, add salt if necessary, and bring to a soft boil.
Reduce heat to a simmer &amp; add a little vinegar for a slight tartness.
Serve with the roasted swan.</b>
<p><b>What?!? No swan at your local market? In case such a fate does befall
you, any large waterfowl will do, such as a goose. However, this is one
of the few times when a turkey may be considered for a medieval feast;
as a substitute for swan, it really is the closest bird in size that most
of us will be able to find. Turkeys were not introduced into Europe until
well after 1500 and for medieval feasts they are quite terribly inappropriate,
but for late Renaissance or Elizabethan feasts, they are acceptable. (See
<a href="../eldin/eldin.html">An
Elizabethan Dinner Conversation</a>, where the master of the house proclaims,
"Cut that turkeycock in pieces, but let it be cold, for it is better cold
than hot.") But, when needing to recreate a medieval dish featuring swan,
the modern cook may turn to turkey as the cheapest and most easily accessible
substitute. Keep in mind, though, that any large bird will also do, so
use turkey only when you're not able to obtain a goose, duck, or even a
large capon.</b>
<p><b>Galingale, a spice made from the root of the Cypress tree, is often
found in stores that sell Asian or Indian foods. You may substitute by
adding a little white pepper to the ginger.</b>
<p><b>The medieval cook was faced with a culinary paradox when "dihyting,"
or preparing, a swan. As a waterfowl, its nature was moist and wet, and
therefore needed to be roasted to counteract those qualities. However,
swans (despite their humoural properties) are notoriously dry &amp; tough,
and roasting only exacerbates this condition. The solution was therefore
to add a moistening agent to the swan, hence the larding. The modern cook
may not be comfortable with this procedure, so applying a coat of olive
oil to the bird before roasting and keeping it well basted will effectively
serve the same purpose.</b>
<p><b>Modern poultry is somewhat "cleaner" and is slaughtered more hygienically
than medieval fowl; scouring the guts with salt may have been necessary
then, but is probably not so now, and only increases the amount of what
is now known to be unhealthy ingredient when used in excess.</b>
<p><b>Interestingly, the toasted breadcrumbs serve as a substitute for
blood! In the <i>Utilis Coquinario</i> recipe which follows the swan &amp;
Chauden receipts, we find a heron prepared "as is &thorn;e swan" with its
sauce "made of hym as a chaudon of gynger &amp; of galyngale, &amp; &thorn;at
it be coloured with &thorn;e blood or with brende crustes &thorn;at arn
tosted." See: <a href="mtrans53.html">Heyroun</a>.</b>
