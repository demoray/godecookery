<p><b>Make a pastry dough of prepared flour, kneaded with yolks of eggs;
&amp; make a stuffing of veal &amp; pork, boiled &amp; ground, with yolks
of eggs; marrow diced, &amp; dates minced; currants; sugar, saffron &amp;
salt &amp; spices; &amp; mix all together. And make your pastry on round
foils of the breadth of a saucer, as thin as may be drawn. Turn it double,
that the edges may come to the middle of the foil; then turn it together
that the edges on the bigger side meet all about, &amp; the smaller side
turn upward without in the manner of a hat. And close well the edges that
they hold well. Fill there-on your stuffing. Have a batter of yolks of
eggs &amp; wheat flour in the open side that is toward. Look there-in the
stuffing be closed, &amp; set it in hot grease upright. When the batter
is fried, you may lay it down &amp; fry it all over.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>INGREDIENTS:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Flour - "prepared" probably means "sifted."</b></li>

<li>
<b>Egg yolks - raw &amp; beaten.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Veal - boiled and ground.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Pork - boiled and ground.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Marrow - diced.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Dates - minced.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Currants</b></li>

<li>
<b>Sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>Saffron</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt - use to taste.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Spices - any period spices you'd prefer: cinnamon, pepper, clove, mace,
cardamom, ginger, cubeb, etc.</b></li>
</ul>
<b><font size=-1>DIRECTIONS:</font></b>
<p><b>Combine the flour and egg yolks until a workable pastry dough is
formed, one capable of being rolled out like ordinary pie dough; set this
aside. Combine veal, pork, egg yolks, marrow, dates, currants, sugar ,
salt, &amp; spices. This mixture should be soft, thick, and moist, and
should hold together like a raw meatloaf or meatball mix. Add egg yolks
as necessary to ensure moistness. Set this mixture aside.</b>
<p><b>Make a thick batter of egg yolks and flour; set aside.</b>
<p><b>Roll out the pastry, and cut it into medium-sized circles. Take a
circle of pastry, and fold it in half, with the middle of the fold on top;
then, fold back the round edges of the circle up to the middle of the fold.
You'll see that a small pocket or cavity is formed at the end opposite
the folded middle - this is the bottom of your "hat." Make sure that the
side edges of the pastry are well sealed so that the hat will stay together
- use a bit of egg yolk or white as "glue" if necessary. Stuff the cavity
with some of the meat mixture (this will round out the pastry into more
of a hat-shape), then cover the entire bottom of the hat with batter, sealing
the meat in completely. Set the hat bottom down in hot oil, cooking until
the batter is done and the filling is completely sealed within, then cook
the entire pastry in the oil until done - the pastry will become puffy
and will lightly brown. Remove from the oil, drain well, and serve.</b>
<p><b>This recipe makes a meat-stuffed pastry which looks like a small
Robin Hood-style hat. Decorate this treat with a feather and the picture
will be perfect!</b>
