<TD><B>The identification of this tree varied among cultures and time periods.
To the Druids, the tree of life was the Oak, due to its age and the fact
that it was the host for mistletoe, their most sacred plant. To the ancient
Hebrews, it <IMG SRC="plant2.jpg" HSPACE=10 BORDER=1 HEIGHT=313 WIDTH=231 ALIGN=RIGHT>was
the Cedar, which provided wood and a delicate, precious oil. The Assyrians
depicted the tree of life as a Date tree, and since they artificially pollinated
their date trees to produce a greater amount of fruit, to them it was not
only a source of food but a symbol of conception. Also, the fruit provided
a date wine which was used as a libation to the gods.</B> 
<P><B>Biblically, the tree of life is the Sycamore, which appears often
in the Scriptures. To most, this suggests the western Sycamore, the Plant
tree (<I>Platanus</I>). However, the ancient Egyptians also regarded the
Sycamore as their sacred &quot;tree of life,&quot; and so the idea that
this is the <I>Platanus</I> Sycamore must be questioned, as that species
is not indigenous to the Nile Valley. In reality, the Sycamore of the Bible
was the wild Fig tree, dedicated to fertility, joy, and the afterlife.
The fig tree has a leaf very similar to that of a mulberry tree, and over
the years the two Greek words for fig and mulberry (<I>sycos</I> and <I>moros</I>)
united to form the name Sycamore. No &quot;real&quot; Sycamore was ever
a tree of life.</B></P>
