<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>8 small game birds, such as quail or partridge, or 4 game hens</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>pork or bacon for barding</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt to taste</b></li>
</ul>
<b>1. Preheat oven to 450&deg;.</b>
<p><b>2. Bard, that is, completely wrap, the cleaned birds with thin strips
of salt pork or bacon. If using game hems, lay strips of bacon over the
breasts.</b>
<p><b>3. Place the birds on a rack in a roasting pan, and put them in the
oven. If using game hens, reduce the oven temperature to 350&deg;. If using
real game birds, roast for five minutes before reducing oven temperature
to 350&deg;. If using game hens, roast them for about an hour, or until
they are done. If real game birds, roast from five to fifteen minutes until
they are done.</b>
<p><b>4. Remove from oven. Arrange birds on a serving platter. Salt to
taste.</b>
<p><b>Serves four to eight.</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>NOTES ON THE RECIPE:</font></b>
<p><b>If you don't know how to slay a plover, or fold the legs of a crane
or heron, you'd have trouble trying to follow these directions. A sarcelle
is a small duck, similar to a teal. Some up-scale supermarkets carry farm-raised
game birds. If you do not have access to the real thing, either wild and
fresh, or packaged and frozen, the ever-popular Rock Cornish game hen can
fill in marvelously.</b>
