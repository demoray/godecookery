<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 C blanched almonds</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 C water</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 C sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>6 large eggs</b></li>

<li>
<b>Yellow food coloring</b></li>
</ul>
<b>1. Grind blanched almonds to a fine paste in a blender or food processor,
adding about half a cup of the water, a tablespoon at a time, during the
grinding. You might want to grind the almonds in two or three batches.</b>
<p><b>2. In a saucepan, combine almond paste with the remaining water and
the sugar, stirring to blend smooth. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and
simmer, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes.</b>
<p><b>3. Pour and scrape the mixture onto a large, clean white cloth, such
as a dinner napkin or tea towel, laid on a large plate or cookie sheet.
Spread the mixture out and let it cool, Then gather up the cloth by the
corners, and gently wring it out over a cup or bowel. Tie the cloth up
like a bag, and hang up the mixture in the cloth over a cup or bowl for
at least three hours.</b>
<p><b>4. Dish the almond cream into a lightly oiled bowl. Refrigerate until
cold.</b>
<p><b>5. Separate out one third of the almond cream, and put it into a
separate bowl. Stir in yellow food coloring a few drops at a time until
it is the color of egg yolk.</b>
<p><b>6. Carefully poke holes into both ends of the eggs, a large hole
at the wide end, and a pin hole at the narrow. Holding each egg over a
bowl, blow through the pin hole, blowing out the yolk and the white into
the bowl. You may refrigerate the yolks and whites for later use. Rinse
out the empty egg shells with warm water.</b>
<p><b>7. Using a pastry tube with a wide nozzle, pipe one third of the
plain almond cream into each egg shell. Using a clean chop stick, or the
blunt end of a pencil, or other clean, blunt stick, tamp the cream down
and pack it against the sides of the shell. Then pipe in yellow cream,
and tamp it down. Pipe in the remaining cream and tamp it down. Leave about
a quarter of an inch space near the open end.</b>
<p><b>8. Preheat oven to 350&deg;. 6. Place the filled egg shells on a
rack in a roasting pan, and bake them for ten minutes to dry out the almond
cream a little. Remove them from the oven, wipe off any drips that may
have occurred, cool, and serve. Serves six to twelve.</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>NOTES ON THE RECIPE:</font></b>
<p><b>This is a great trick: intact egg shells filled with sweet almond
paste, including a yolk in the middle! These "eggs" are popular with my
family and friends, who expect them every year at Mid-Lent. I have also
used raw, dyed Easter eggs. I have chosen to use modern food coloring instead
of saffron and cinnamon, mostly for convenience.</b>
