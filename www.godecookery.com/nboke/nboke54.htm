<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=-1>ORIGINAL RECEIPT:</font></b>
<p><b>In order to explain the Tremollete to the person who will be making
it, take a great quantity of poultry gizzards and livers, prepare them
very cleanly and put them in a pot, with beef and mutton bouillon to plump
them; then put them on slender wooden spits and roast them over glowing
coals. Then take enough bread for the quantity of the sauce which you are
to make, and cut it into good slices and set these to toast on the grill;
when your bread is toasted, get the amount of beef or mutton bouillon you
need, and check that it is not too salty; then take good wine and verjuice
and put it into the bouillon along with the soaked bread, in a good two-handled
pot or bucket. Take your gizzards and livers, put them into a mortar and
grind them thoroughly, moistening them with the bouillon in which your
bread is soaking; then take your gizzards and livers out of the mortar
and put them into the bouillon in which your bread is soaking. Take spices:
white ginger, cinnamon, grains of paradise, a little pepper--but don't
let it be too pronounced--nutmegs, mace and cloves; and of each of these
spices watch that you put in only a moderate amount. Set it all to boil
in good clean kettle, and then add in sugar, but not so much that it takes
away the verjuice taste because it should not be sweetish. After this,
take all of the roast partridge you have to the dressing table and the
Household Stewards will come to decide how many of them are to be put on
each dish to serve kings, dukes, counts--for example, six partridge on
one dish, five on another, four on another, and three on another. And,
over the top, the tremollete. And there should be an ample provision of
two hundred cockerels and young poultry ready for serving in case the partridge
runs out.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 pound of mixed chicken gizzards and livers</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 qt beef bouillon or lamb stock</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 C toasted white bread crumbs</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 C dry wine</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 T white grape juice</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 T wine vinegar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 tsp sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/8 tsp powdered ginger</b></li>

<li>
<b>Pinch of each cinnamon, allspice, black pepper, nutmeg, mace, and cloves</b></li>
</ul>
<b>1. In a pot, over medium heat, bring bouillon or lamb stock to a boil,
and add gizzards and livers. Reduce heat, and simmer, covered, for twenty
minutes, or until gizzards are tender. Remove from heat, and let cool.</b>
<p><b>2. In a blender or food processor, grind the gizzards and livers
to a paste, adding a quarter cup of bouillon or stock in the process.</b>
<p><b>3. In a saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups of bouillon or stock and bread
crumbs. Let stand for fifteen minutes.</b>
<p><b>4. Add giblet paste and remaining ingredients to the bouillon and
bread crumbs. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer five minutes, stirring
frequently.</b>
<p><b>5. Serve over roast partridge or other fowl.</b>
<p><b>Yields two and a half cups of sauce. Serves four to six.</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>NOTES ON THE RECIPE:</font></b>
<p><b>This sauce is similar to the <a href="nboke43.htm">Chauden</a> sauce
given previously, but I have given it a sharper taste. I have reduced the
amount of ingredients called for.</b>
<p><b>I substitute wine vinegar and white grape juice for verjuice.</b>
<p><b>I substitute allspice for grains of paradise.</b>
<p><b>I have chosen not to grill the gizzards after boiling them.</b>
<p><b>The sauce for <a href="nboke47.htm">Ffesaunte Rosted</a> and <a href="nboke26.htm">Sauce
Camelyne</a> were also considered suitable for partridge.</b>
