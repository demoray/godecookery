<p><b><font size=-1>ORIGINAL RECEIPT:</font></b>
<p><b>With that, Fish Pies:&nbsp; to instruct the person who will be doing
this job--because not everyone is a master of it--he should get his fish,
that is, good bellies of tuna, good big filets of carp, good big fresh
eels--and of all that he should get the quantity that is needed for the
number of pies that he is ordered to make; take all of it and cut it into
good-sized pieces and set it to cook in a good clean cauldron appropriate
in size for the amount you have; when it is cooked, take it out onto fine
tables which are good and clean, and cull through all your fish to remove
any scales or bones, then chop it up well.&nbsp; Get good candied figs,
prunes and dates and slice these up small, to the size of small dice; get
pinenuts and have them cleaned thoroughly and get candied raisins and clean
them well so there are no seeds left; of all of this take an amount proper
for the amount of the fish filling you are making, wash it well in white
wine, then mix it in with your fish in a fine pan.&nbsp; Then get another
pan which is good and clean in which you will clarify good fine oil; when
it is clarified put enough of that oil into your filling for that amount
of it, then set it on hot coals to heat up, and stir it continuously with
a good spoon.&nbsp; Then get good spice powder and put in a reasonable
amount of it, and a lot of sugar.&nbsp; Then order your pastry cook to
make large or small pie shells for you, and they should be covered.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Pastry dough for two nine-inch pie crusts</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 pound fresh tuna, carp, eel, herring, or other fish</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 C each figs, pitted prunes, pitted dates, cut in halves or thirds,
and raisins</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 C pine nuts</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 T oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 C sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp powdered ginger</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/8 tsp each black pepper and cloves</b></li>
</ul>
<b>1.&nbsp; Preheat oven to 350&deg;.</b>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; In a pot, over medium heat, bring water to a boil.&nbsp;
Add fish, reduce heat, and simmer for about ten minutes or until the fish
is cooked through.&nbsp; Drain.</b>
<p><b>3.&nbsp; Cut the fish up very small, removing any bones.</b>
<p><b>4.&nbsp; In a pot, over low heat, combine fish, dried fruit, spices,
oil, and sugar.&nbsp; Heat the mixture thoroughly, stirring constantly,
for about five minutes.</b>
<p><b>5.&nbsp; Line a pie pan with the crust.&nbsp; Fill the crust with
the fish and fruit mixture, and cover the pie with the second crust, piercing
it in several places.&nbsp; Bake for half an hour.</b>
<p><b>Serves eight to twelve.</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>NOTES ON THE RECIPE:</font></b>
<p><b>Fish and fruit pies seem to have been popular in the Middle Ages.&nbsp;
I have used regular dried figs and seedless raisins, rather than candied
ones.&nbsp; You don't need to clarify modern cooking oil.&nbsp; The good
spice powder I use is ginger, pepper and cloves.</b>
