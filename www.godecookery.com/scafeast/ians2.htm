<p><b>Notes on the Feast:</b>
<p><b>This was a late, late-period Inn event in which I actually allowed
myself the luxury of cooking with potatoes (an ingredient which should
for the most part NEVER be used at Medieval/Renaissance feasts). Most recipes
were traditional English, and the opening course contained the elements
of <i>A Ploughman's Lunch</i>, traditional English pub foods. Coffee and
tea, hardly ever found at authentic SCA feasts, were welcome late-period
additions to this dinner. I was able to find real gooseberries, but had
to make do with substituting molasses for treacle.</b>
<p><a NAME="po"></a><b><font size=+1>Pickled Onions</font> - these were
made by boiling small, peeled whole onions until just tender; after draining
well, they were placed in a large glass jar and covered with the same pickling
sauce used in the <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/begrec/begrec72.htm">Pickled
Eggs</a>, and then allowed to sit for several weeks before serving.</b>
<p><a NAME="louse"></a><b><font size=+1>Mother Louse Porter</font> - this
was a home-made porter made by brewer Dan McNeil of Morgantown, WV especially
for this event, named in honor of Mother Louse, an English alewife who
was reportedly <i>"the last woman in England to wear a ruff."</i></b>

<p><b><a href="../afeast/brew/brew005.html">HERE IS A WOODCUT OF MOTHER
LOUSE</a></b></center>

<p><a NAME="rice"></a><b><font size=+1>Rice</font> - this was simple, plain
white rice, spread out over the serving platters to place the <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/begrec/begrec77.htm">Honey-Glazed
Chicken</a> on; the chicken itself was cooked &amp; served in pieces, not
as whole hens as the original recipe calls for.</b>
<p><a NAME="trif"></a><b><font size=+1>Trifle</font> - this was a modified
version on an English Trifle, with layers of cake, cream &amp; fruits in
a large serving bowl.</b>

<p><b>Master Huen Damebrigge of Wychwood has been cooking feasts for the
SCA since 1980; he still cooks for approximately 2-3 official events a
year. Master Huen currently resides in the Barony-Marche of the Debatable
Lands in AEthelmearc.</b>
