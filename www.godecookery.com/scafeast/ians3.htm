<p><b>Notes on the Feast:</b>
<p><b>This feast was unique in that it was presented "Inn-style" - guests
had a several-hour period in which to come to the dining hall. Once there,
they were seated by Lord Ian, playing the Host of the Inn, and given drink,
bread &amp; butter, soup, &amp; salad by their table's server (i.e. waitress/waiter).
The server then took the diner's orders for the main entree: a choice of
poultry, beef, or fish. The order was taken to the kitchen, and the server
returned to the table with a full plate of food for the guest. Diners also
had the option of eating outdoors on the lawn surrounding the dining hall.
The dessert board was served outside at twilight, under a large, candle-lit
pavilion.</b>

and a few whole maces and some marie, and put to this broth a good quantity
of white Wine or of Clarret, and so let them seethe softlye together. Then

a skillet of faire seething water, and put your sliced Orenges into the
water and when that water is bitter, have more readie and change them still

<p><b>In the original recipe, capon is boiled with veal or marrow in preparation
for the orange sauce; for this feast, the capon was replaced with whole
chicken breasts, and instead of being boiled was dredged in flour and then
roasted. A sauce was made from chicken broth, white wine, orange juice,
currants, prunes, mace, cinnamon, ginger, sugar, &amp; vinegar (the marrow
was left out); the roasted chicken breast was placed in baking pans, covered
with sauce, and baked until tender.</b>

<p><b>The author of <i>To the Queen's Taste</i> recommends several substitutes
for the salmon in this recipe, including halibut, cod, &amp; pollack. For
this event, pollack was used. The fish was placed in a large baking pan
