<p><b><font color="#000000">Notes on the Feast:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>First Course - England</u>: Four of the
recipes in this remove were adapted by Madge Lorwin in <i>Dining With William
Shakespeare</i>. The Pork Pie is based on a recipe in William Rabisha's
<i>The
Whole Body of Cookery Dissected</i>, 1661, called <i>"To Bake Pork to be
eaten cold."</i> The Manchet is based on a recipe that Lorwin adapted from
Gervase Markham's <i>The English Hus-wife</i>, 1615, but I simply had to
add a little sugar to the recipe for fear the bread would be unappetizingly
heavy. I also formed the bread into more of a baguette shape than a round
manchet for ease in sharing out amongst the diners at table. The Buttered
Carrots and Marchpane were taken from Robert May's
<i>The Accomplished
Cook</i>, 1660. The decoration for the Marchpane comes from a reference
in Lorwin's book to a New Year's gift Queen Elizabeth received from her
master cook, George Webster, a <i>"faire marchpane being a chessboarde"</i>
(<font size=-1>1</font>). The Mock Entrails are a much earlier recipe taken
from <i>Harleian MS 4016</i>, circa 1450 (<font size=-1>2</font>), by Cindy
Renfrow in <i>Take a Thousand Eggs or More</i>.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Second Course - Scotland</u>: I am aware
that simply because a dish is considered "traditional" this doesn't mean
that it's pedigree is sufficiently antique to qualify it as period. The
dishes in this remove do not come directly from period sources. Cock-a-leekie,
a chicken and leek soup, and Pickled Salmon are from an early twentieth
century book of traditional recipes and kitchen lore collected by F. Marian
McNeill (see bibliography). The ingredients are period and the concepts
involved, those of chicken soup and pickled fish, are certainly period.
These recipes required adaptation as those in the book do not include measurements
of ingredients. This book also contains a recipe for Shortbread, a dish
that can be found under various names in a number of variations in English
cookbooks of the sixteenth century. Simple recipes for shortbread being
quite common in modern cookbooks, I saw no need to reinvent the dish. I
simply used the recipe in an old, favorite cookie cookbook of mine.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Third Course - Germany</u>: Roast Chicken
Stuffed with Apples and Prunes is a variation on a dish that, according
to Esther Arresty, she found in "an early German cookbook" (<font size=-1>3</font>).
It was a duck stuffed with apples and prunes, but chickens are not only
much more inexpensive, they have far more meat and less fat than ducks,
hence my substitution. It's a dish still popular in Scandinavia and Germany.
The Spiced Red Cabbage is based on a recipe in a modern German cookbook,
but Arresty mentions sauerkraut, which is pickled cabbage, as appearing
in 16th century German cookbooks (<font size=-1>4</font>). Unfortunately,
she doesn't reprint any of the recipes for this, but the ingredients I
have used would have been available to cooks in period and not, I think,
inconsistent with what they would have done. Pickled cabbage may well have
changed little over the centuries. The Potato Cakes may seem a surprising
inclusion, but it is true that potatoes were cultivated and accepted as
normal food in some areas of Europe before the seventeenth century. Recipes
using potatoes appear in German cookbooks for the first time in 1581, in
<i>Ein
Neu Kochbuch</i> by Marx Rumpolt. Cakes of grated potatoes with onions
similar in concept to our hash browns appeared in a book written in German
and printed in Switzerland in 1598 (<font size=-1>5</font>).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Fourth Course - France</u>: That Roast Beef
is period requires no proof (<font size=-1>6</font>). The peppercorn sauce
that will be served with it, Sauce Poivrade, was adapted by Esther Arresty
from <i>Le Cuisinier Francois</i> by Francois Pierre de La Varenne, 1651.
The other two dishes are redacted from recipes in
<i>Menagier de Paris</i>,
1393. The Black Porray, a dish of greens seasoned with bacon, comes to
us by way of Heiatt and Butler's <i>Pleyn Delit</i>. The Mushroom Pasties
are my adaptation of the recipe as it appeared in Edna Eileen Power's 1928
translation of <i>Menagier</i>.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Fifth Course - Ancient Rome</u>: All three
recipes appear in Apicius' <i>De re Coquinaria</i> as translated by Joseph
Dommers Vehling. The redactions used are my own. The Seafood Mince With
Shrimp and Scallops is adapted from <i>"Isicia,"</i> which listed a number
of different sea creatures to choose from in making the dish. Shrimp wasn't
on the list, but it seemed in the spirit of the thing and many of the choices
listed would be prohibitively expensive. The recipe fails to mention how
these minces were to be cooked, but other recipes for minces that follow
advise one to poach them in broth or liquamen so I followed that method.
Mushrooms in Wine appears as <i>"Boletos Fungos"</i> in Apicius and Stuffed
Dates in Honey are closely adapted from <i>"Dulciaria."</i></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Sixth Course - Turkey</u>: All of the recipes
in this remove are found in Algar's <i>Classical Turkish Cooking</i>. According
to Algar, both yoghurt and cooked skewered meats are referred to in Mahmud
alKashghari's <i>Diwan Lughat al-Turk</i>, an eleventh century Turkish-Arabic
dictionary (<font size=-1>7</font>). These are, of course, the main components
of the Lamb Kebabs with Yoghurt Sauce. I left out the non-period element
of the chosen recipe, a roasted tomato sauce, and substituted a simple
yoghurt-garlic sauce. Pilafs made with a variety of grains first made their
appearance in fifteenth century Turkey (<font size=-1>8</font>), and Bulgur
Pilaf with Chick Peas doesn't appear to contain any modern innovations.
I feel that I am on safe ground with the Sweat Saffron Rice with Pistachios
and Almonds as well. Certainly rice puddings were made in period in Europe
(<font size=-1>9</font>), and, rice having come from the east in the early
Middle Ages (<font size=-1>10</font>), it's quite likely that rice puddings
were made in the east as well. In fact, Bartolomeo Scappi in <i>The Private
Cook of Pope Pius V (Cuoco Secreto di Papa Pio Quinto),</i> 1570, refers
to a dish on a feast menu as <i>"Rice in Turkish Style with milk, served
with sugar and cinnamon over it"</i> (<font size=-1>11</font>). The Pide
served here is a version of the flat bread that has been common in the
middle east for countless centuries.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Seventh Course - Italy</u>: Two of the recipes
used were printed in an article on pre-Columbian Italian food in <i>The
Times Picayune-States Item</i> newspaper on the occasion of the 500th anniversary
of Columbus' first voyage. Cherry Tort came originally from <i>Libro di
Arte Coquinaria</i>, first printed in the fifteenth century. The Sweet
and Sour Onions do come from a modern cookbook, <i>Mediterranean Cookery</i>
by Claudia Roden, but Ms. Roden is always careful to present authentic
recipes in her books and the combination of flavors in the dish is one
that would not be out of place on a table in period. Neither the ingredients
nor the cooking method would place it out-of-period.</font></b>
