IV and Elayna Lilley II</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">A compendium detailing the recipes and notes
necessary to create a Kingdom-level Italian feast to feed a sum of one
hundred and sixty people at the Coronation of Their Royal Majesties in
the Spring of A.S. 33, also known as the Mundane Year 2000.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000">&copy; 1999-2000 Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Dedication: For their unfailing support and
never-ending patience, this booklet is dedicated with respect to Their
Excellencies, Mistress Rebekah MacTiernan and Sir Brannos O'longardail,
the fiftieth King and Queen to sit on the Dragon Throne.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This booklet is also dedicated with love to
Kamiizumi Jirou Munenori for believing that any dish created and set before

too fast.</font></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>How the Recipes Were Chosen</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#000000">The main goals for this feast were as follows:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Recipes had to be chosen or constructed from a
single, documentable cookbook or manuscript wherever possible.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">The food had to taste good, if not fantastic,
and pass muster from local picky eaters.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">The feast had to be balanced such that no one
particular dish or course would cause what the original author of the cookbook
believed to be an imbalance in nutrition or a serious risk to health.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">Seasonal food availability had to be taken advantage
of as often as possible.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font color="#000000">The royalty for whom the feast was created had
to approve of the dishes.</font></b></li>
</ul>
<b><font color="#000000">All aspects of the feast including the recipe
choices, the number of courses, garnishing, table decorations, and serving
were centered around achieving these goals.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">With one exception, all of the recipes prepared
and served for this feast were taken directly from or constructed using
Mary Ella Milham's 1998 translation of Platina's <u>De honesta voluptate
(On Right Pleasure)</u>. This manuscript is currently dated by Milham at
1465, and details recipes from Italy of that time. Many of the recipes
were taken directly from earlier manuscripts, among them the works of C.
Matius, Apicius, and Martino de Rossi. Health information included in the
recipes was often taken from Pliny the Elder's <u>Historia Naturalis (Natural
History)</u> and from the Arabic tradition of medicine known as the <u>regimen
sanitatis</u> which we are able to read in the works of Ibn Butlan and
others.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The recipes for this feast were chosen and
placed in their serving order based on the details provided by Platina
for the best ways and times to serve particular foods during multi-course
meals. Platina summarizes our reasoning behind our decisions when he writes
(as translated by Milham):</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><i>Not all foods suit all people, but as there
are various elements and various appetites of men according to their humors,
as well as various tastes, so ought there too be various foods so that
each may acquire what is agreeable, flavorful, and nutritious. To my mind,
no one eats what fills him with distaste, or harms or pains, or kills...
remember that saying of Socrates, that we should eat to live and not live
to eat.</i> (pg. 115, 117)</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Seasonal food choices and choices of foods
that would yield the most number of dishes were very important considerations
when choosing recipes for the feast. Mistress Alizaunde's (Demoiselle de
Bregeuf, C.O.L. SCA) article <u><a href="http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/recipes/rprf.sca.feasts.html">Rob
Peter to Feed Paul: Halving Feast Costs</a></u> served as an excellent
starting point. Combined with a list of regional food crops from the local
farmer's market, choosing dishes based on seasonal choices, and by the
same token, eliminating dishes based on the same criteria, was made quite
a bit easier because the possibilities were greatly narrowed due to extreme
cost or unavailability of ingredients.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Overall, some compromises were made to Platina's
recipes or their ingredients in order to accommodate a mundane balance
of dishes that would allow vegans and vegetarians to participate in the
feast. On the whole, however, those changes were balanced by the placement
of other dishes said by Platina to combat the negative side effects of
the other dishes in any particular course. We also attempted to make any
changes to dishes match actual substitutions or alternatives suggested
by Platina. For example, in a dish where Platina recommended the main meat
be pork, we chose to substitute, per his suggestion, with fowl. Thus, in
attempting to create a pleasing feast, we have attempted what Platina says
any good cook should do:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><i>One should have a trained cook with skill
and long experience, patient with his work and wanting especially to be
praised for it. He should... know in a suitable way the force and nature
of meats, fish and vegetables so that he may understand what ought to be
roasted, boiled, or fried.</i> (pg. 119)</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">With the exception of long experience - unless
you total the entire staff's cooking years - we have tried to do just what
Platina described when he described a good cook.</font></b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Notes on the Recipe Write-ups</font></font></b></center>
<b><font color="#000000"><u>The sections of each recipe</u>:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The recipes detailed herein are written up
in such a way that you are provided with the recipe translation from Milham's
edition, our interpretation of what the original recipe says to do for
preparation, ingredients for both a standard family meal and scaled amounts
for feasts, and information on how we would or did actually prepare the
dish. Because of the difficulty in accurately typing and checking the accuracy
of the Latin, we do not include the normalized Latin text from Platina's
manuscript.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In addition to the preparation instructions
noted above, if special cooking hints such as alternative ways of cooking
could be or were considered, we provide them after the main preparation
notes. Finally, if there were particular things we learned from testing
the dishes on unsuspecting friends and relatives, the notes from those
lessons learned are detailed at the end of the recipe. We have tried to
comment on each recipe with lessons learned from both the test feast and
the actual coronation feast to help people understand the difficulties
and differences inherent cooking for 8 as opposed to 160.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>About ingredient names</u>:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">It is worth noting that each ingredient is
worded carefully to avoid confusion. Specifically, the order of the descriptive
words is placed so that you can tell how to measure and prepare the ingredients
if it makes a difference as to which activity comes first. For example,
if a recipe calls for "1/2 cup sifted flour" this means "Sift the flour,
then measure out 1/2 cup." If, on the other hand, a recipe calls for "1/2
cup flour, sifted" then it means "Measure out 1/2 cup flour. Sift this
1/2 cup flour and use it in the recipe." Or, when referring to weight measurements,
an ingredient might be listed as "one pound deboned chicken" which means
"one pound of chicken as weighed after the bones have been removed." Compare
this to the wording "one pound chicken, deboned" which would mean "one
pound of chicken as weighed with the bones in, then take the bones out."</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Weights and Measures</u>:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Because translation and recipe interpretation
is rarely an exact science, exact measurements in the recipes in this booklet
should not be considered crucial. You should feel free to adjust any of
the measurements in this booklet according to your taste or as instinct
and experience dictates. This is especially true with the recipe amounts
for the large number of servings.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">We have assumed that the primary audience for
this booklet will be residents of North America. As such, ingredient names,
weights, and measurements given in the recipes should be viewed as American
standards. None of the recipes in this booklet contain metric equivalents.
British cooks should note that standard U.S. measuring utensils are smaller
than the ones they are familiar with. In both the United States and Britain,
however, 3 teaspoons = 1 tablespoon (4 U.S. tablespoons=1/4 cup). Please
remember to use liquid measures for liquids and dry measures for all other
ingredients. The two measurements are not the same.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">As we approached the day of the feast, it became
abundantly clear that we would be unable to bake the bread ourselves. Fortunately,
we had access to a local bakery with a standard loaf that we were told
very nearly matched the one we desired to make. We chose to purchase this
loaf in lieu of making the bread and save ourselves some time for other
dishes.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Our feasters commented quite loudly on the
topic of bread, with most asking for more of the loaf we served, not knowing,
of course, exactly how much food was still on the way to their tables.
The loaves were of good size, perhaps half again the size of a standard
shoebox, and the perfect companion for the moretum spread with which we
served it.</font></b>
<p><a NAME="moretum"></a><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.godecookery.com/friends/frec70.htm">Moretum</a></font>
(Garlic and Herb Cheese Pat&eacute;) - the recipe is found <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/friends/frec70.htm">HERE</a></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This recipe information originally appeared
in A Taste of Ancient Rome, by Ilaria Giacosa (p. 54). It is the only recipe
in the feast taken from a book other than Platina's cooking manuscript.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This was a very popular dish at the test feast.
The original recipe may have possibly called for far more garlic than what
appears here. To account for possible translation errors, that amount was
reduced in the original recipe to a single head of garlic. At preparation
time, the amount of garlic was reduced by half again because the cook's
eyes were smarting from the fumes. When the feaster's tasted the dish they
all agreed that the garlic could be reduced even further to account for
the palates of the faint at heart. That final reduction is the amount listed
in the ingredients above.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The moretum for the coronation feast was surprisingly
well received considering a bad miscalculation of the amount of vinegar
for this dish. Initially, nearly twice the amount of vinegar we had calculated
as necessary for texture was accidently added to this dish. We considered
several options to salvage the now incorrectly prepared moretum. We could
have simply doubled the recipe ingredients sans vinegar and dealing with
the leftover dish. Instead, we took a cue from cheese making techniques
and used some cheese cloth we had available to bundle up the moretum and
drain as much of the excess vinegar as possible. The end result was slightly
tangy and much less garlicky than the version we served at the test feast.
The texture was grainier than the original was, but not unpleasantly so,
and the salt of the fresh cheese was nearly removed with the excess vinegar
drained.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Post-feast research indicates on particularly
enlightening discovery for us. Not being Latin scholars, the terms "moretum"
and "mortaria" held little significance for us other than a curious relation
to the mundane term "mortar." Flower and Rosenbaum's Apicius introduction,
previously unread prior to the feast, provided us with an interesting commentary
we that relates to our dish described here. The authors state:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><i>Many recipes begin by taking pepper or various
herbs, which are put in the mortar and pounded or ground. While stone mortars
may have been employed in some cases, stout pottery bowls known to archaeologists
as mortaria probably did duty in most cases, and these are made with a
sprinkling of grit baked into the fabric to help with the grinding process.
Stone or wooden pestles were used with them. </i>(pg. 37)</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This explains the title of the dish and affords
us with more recipes in comparison to to Grant's copy. In the first book
of Paicius, a chapter dedicated in part to sauces, Apicius gives us ingredients
for Moretaria (pg. 61). In our minds, this justifies our decision to use
vinegar as a thinning and smoothing agent in the sauce. To date, however,
our only evidence for eating moretum with bread is tenuous. A footnote
in Apicius mentions Pliny's work <u>Historia naturalis</u> and states that
one type of bread, made by the people of Picenum, was only eaten in a moistened
state (Flower &amp; Rosenbaum, pg. 99). Though the original reference is
to a dip of milk and honey, we instead chose moretum to balance the overall
humoral qualities of the feast.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the

<p><b><font color="#000000">The eggs were popular with none left over.
In general, the testers agreed that the filling was moist (one tester thought
the filling should be a little drier) and tasty. The raisins in the recipe
were the most common reason for texture being cited as less than perfect.The
texture could be improved by using a food processor for all ingredients.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the large amounts required for the coronation
feast, we found that the mixture was far too dry to hold together on its
own without the addition of the optional egg whites. At the time of the
main feast, we had no extra whites to spare because we had planned to omit
them. To compensate for the over-dry filling and because we had not whites,
we increased the vinegar substantially and added a small amount of olive
oil to moisten the filling. Taking our own advice, we decided to forego
the final reassembly step and serve the eggs open-faced.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">All the feasters very much enjoyed this dish,
citing the firmness of the pears (soft enough to cut through with a fork,
but not mushy or overcooked) and the understated sweetness of the dish
as their favorite points about it. We did not add the optional sugar. This
dish received the most comments regarding its presentation. Pear halves
were arranged in the round with their flat side down, drizzled with the
boiled down grape juice in which they were cooked, and garnished with a
simple sprig of fresh mint.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">During the canning process, a fairly serious
non-injury accident left us with approximately 1/3 less of the original
amount of pears we had intended to serve for the feast. Our compromise
was not to buy more fresh pears and preserve them, as the special price
we had received on the original feast amount was no longer in effect. Instead
we chose to buy commercially preserved pears to augment what had already
been canned at home. Our reasoning was three fold. First, more fresh pears
would have cost significantly more money than we had intended to spend.
By the time of the accident, the pears were expensive enough that commercially
preserved pears were cheaper. Second, in period, fresh pears were often
preserved in honey alone (cf. Apicius and Platina on fruit preservation).
Although not an exact substitution, pears in canned in heavy syrup mimicked
the sweet nature of the period-style home canned pears. The juice from
the grape-juice canned pears was sufficient enough in quantity to allow
us to sauce both home-canned and commercially preserved pears alike without
making more syrup. Third, the color contrast of the purple pears and the
white pears was quite attractive.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the

<p><b><font color="#000000">A previously tested version of this pie convinced
us not to use the optional rosewater as it was overpowering in even small
amounts (the taste is often considered "soapy" by some people). Therefore
we did not include it in this recipe. Of all the dishes served in the test
feast, this one received the highest praise. No other dish was requested
again more than this one. The most heard comment was "What is the flavor?
That's so intriguing." When told that the main flavoring was elder flowers,
few feasters believed us.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">As always, this pie did not fail to delight
us. Having made the recipe numerous time since first redacting the recipe,
we were once again genuinely pleased with the results of the baking. We
did, however, discover an incredible excess of filling using the quantities
stated herein for the 160 servings. We are unsure of why this is, but there
are three possibilities. First, there simply could have been too much filling
for 20 pies. While possible, it seems unlikely as the overage at the test
feast and subsequent makings of this pie resulted in very little waste.
Second, the pies purchased could have been much smaller in diameter than
the ones used for the test feast (e.g. 8-inch diameter pies rather than
9-inch or 10-inch diameter pies). Third, the pies could have been shallower
than the deep-dish crusts we normally use. Both the second and third explanations
seem likely. We suggest you play with the recipe quantities based on the
pie crusts you will use to account for an apparent overage in our calculations
at the 160-serving level.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; Oven timing with other
feast dishes</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The mushrooms and the onions from the second
course can easily share oven space. Consider roasting the onions and at
the half-way point in their cooking, place the pan of mushrooms in at the
same temperature to maximize oven use.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the original feast plan, the mushrooms and
pine nuts were to be served side by side with the lentils and barley. A
mistake on the part of the head cook resulted in the roasted onions entering
the oven far too late for the first course, thus the mushrooms and the
onions switched positions in the feast. This mistake worked to our advantage
as the mushrooms according to Platina should be served with pears (so we
chose to serve them nearer the pears). The move of the roasted onions originally
scheduled for this slot in the feast vastly improved the flavor of the
lentil dish served in the second course.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">We did not purchase 40 pounds of mushrooms
for this feast; in fact we despaired finding mushrooms of decent quality
at all in time for the grand event. The mushrooms were finally purchased
at 1 a.m. the morning of the feast at one of the last possible stores to
which we had access. In the end, we bought all the Portobelo mushrooms
the store had and supplemented this amount with as many of the Crimini
bulk mushrooms as we could to make up the difference. Fortunately, the
Portobelo's were some of the largest we've ever seen in our lives. Served
cleaned, with their stems removes and served whole, these mushrooms were
large enough to serve one per table with a handful of Crimini's to round
out the dish. Of all the dishes, second servings of this one were requested
most often.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">This dish was surprisingly popular among test
feasters. The most prevalent comment about the meatballs was that the flavor
was exceptional. We believe this was due to the rich broth in which the
meatballs were boiled. The main concerns upon serving this dish were the
use of spices (many people find the use of traditionally "sweet" spices
odd) and the texture of the meatballs. All feasters felt the mixture of
spices was neither out of place nor heavy handed. The texture of the meatballs,
however, was an issue of debate. To most of the test feasters, these meatballs
lacked the "toothy" quality prevalent in sausage or beef meatballs. All
feasters agreed the texture suffered in those meatballs that didn't have
ingredients evenly distributed. Fine mincing of all ingredients was suggested
by all test feasters, with encouragement to make use of a stand mixer for
the actual feast (the test feast dish was prepared with hand-mixing alone).</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Through a mistake in mixing, we discovered
that omitting the cheese in the meatballs actually improved the texture,
in our opinion. We were also unable to get our veal stock to come to a
boil on the large stove we were using for the purpose. Rather than using
this stock to boil the meatballs as we had originally intended, we cooked
the meatballs in a convection oven sitting in a bath of the veal stock.
Part way through the cooking we turned the meatballs to ensure even browning.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">It is interesting to note that the head cook
disliked this dish from the beginning. While tasty, the texture was the
one factor that could not be accounted for in time for the feast. Rather
than replace the dish with another, we chose to serve it anyway, despite
the head cook's reservations, to our benefit considering the fine reception
and rave reviews the dish got from the populace.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Due to dietary restrictions and personal requests,
we chose not to serve the pasta with sugar or sweet spices. We cooked far
more pasta than was really needed at the test feast. The leftovers stored
well in the refrigerator for several days allowing the head cook to have
lunch at work far more often than she'd originally planned.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">To improve the appearance of the meatball dish,
when it was served, we chose to cook an excess of pasta and place the meatballs
on top. By filling the tray on which the meatballs were served, we covered
up the rather non-period Thanksgiving turkeys that were impressed into
the base of the trays (a surprise to everyone, as no one had noticed this
prior to the feast). Much to our surprise, very little pasta was returned
from the feast hall.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Even though it was a simple collection of European
greens, this dish too received comments. Two comments were most telling.
First, feasters believed the dish had just enough dressing on it to taste,
but not so much that the lettuce was soggy. This came as a surprise to
the cooks who thought the dish looked too dry. Second, one feaster commented
on the placement of the dish between courses as ideal. This was the result
of poor oven timing turned to our advantage. The cooks were waiting on
a second course dish to come out of the oven and thus served the lettuce
between the first and second courses rather than in the second course as
originally planned.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Rather than determining how much salad to serve
each feaster, we chose to purchase enough salad to comfortably fill 20,
12-inch diameter pasta dishes with a mound of salad. We had excess salad
dressing left over upon plating the dish and thus believe the 160-serving
amounts listed here are approximately 1/3 too great.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Fresh herbs were essential to the success of
this dish. The texture seemed ideal despite initial cooking indications
to the contrary (the dish seemed slow to start cooking).</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Despite Platina's insistence that sugar is
an excellent food, we chose not to add it to this dish because of the sugar
being used in the dessert course. Also, the original recipe called for
egg whites exclusively, but when combining the eggs with the cheese-herb
mixture, the cooks felt the filling appeared too dry and added a single,
whole egg. The dryness of the mixture prior to cooking may have been the
result of the choice of cheeses used rather than the lack of enough eggs
in the mixture.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The dish reheats well and travels well. The
cooks agreed that this dish would be a welcome change from bread, cheese,
and meat chunks at non-camping weekend events. Feasters commented on this
possibility as well.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Cheese purchased for this pie seemed to be
far saltier than the cheese we used for the test feast. We suspect this
was the brand of cheese rather than the salt used in the recipe, but another
possibility might be the spinach. The area around which the spinach was
grown was known for its salt flats. A third possibility would be the pie
crusts, though salt was not listed as an ingredient on the commercial labels.
Consider omitting the salt from this recipe entirely as it may not be necessary
given the combination of cheese, spinach, and pie crusts you use.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The original amounts for this recipe as we
served it were far too great. Of all the dishes, this one had the most
leftovers, not necessarily because of flavor or texture, but because of
sheer amount. In the original feast plan, the mushrooms and pine nuts were
to be served side by side with the lentils and barley. A mistake on the
part of the head cook resulted in the roasted onions entering the oven
far too late for the first course, thus the mushrooms and the onions switched
positions in the feast. This mistake turned out to be a fortuitous one.
The lentil dish was rather unremarkable to the point of being bland to
most feasters. One feaster discovered that the roasted onions placed on
the lentils sparked up both dishes. The remaining feasters followed suit
and as a result, the cooks decided to serve the lentils covered with the
onions for the actual feast.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">When we mixed the lentils and the barley for
this dish, we decided that the visual texture warranted reducing the amount
of cooked barley by approximately one quarter. There still seemed to be
enough of the dish to feed all the feasters sufficiently. We were particularly
pleased with the flavor of the final dish. As no vegetarians had contacted
us requesting notification of dish ingredients, we chose to use excess
veal stock from the butchering process to cook the barley. We served this
dish cold topped with the hot, roasted onions.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; Oven timing with other
feast dishes</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The mushrooms in the first course and the onions
can easily share oven space. Consider roasting the onions and at the half-way
point in their cooking, place the pan of mushrooms in at the same temperature
to maximize oven use.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">On the whole, the feasters were unused to seeing
onions as a vegetable side dish. While universally accepted as tasty, their
inclusion received only lukewarm reception until one of the feasters discovered
that placing the onions on top of the lentils and barley dish greatly enhanced
both dishes. For this reason, we chose to serve the onion dish atop the
lentils and barley dish at the coronation feast to improve the flavor and
acceptance of both dishes.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the larger quantities, the amount of vinegar
and water listed for this dish seemed excessive and increased the cooking
time of the onions significantly. In retrospect, we would reduce the amount
of total liquid by at least 1/3 when cooking the larger quantity. Fresh
ground, rather than per-ground black pepper seemed to vastly improve this
dish. Having tried this dish multiple times since the original redaction,
we have decided we prefer the smaller, sweet onions or red onions to the
larger white and yellow onions commonly sold in supermarkets today.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the
Test Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Because veal is a dry meat, with the young
cow not having lived long enough to obtain any mentionable fat in its flesh,
we found it was quite easy to overcook this dish. We also discovered that
different areas of standard kitchen ovens will produce differently cooked
meat (our oven had hot and hotter spots). Grilling may have avoided some
of the oven problems we experienced, but winter grilling didn't seem prudent
at the time. In general, the dish was extremely well liked, but enjoyed
even more when served with sauce.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">We believe little could have been done to improve
this dish. In retrospect, and contrary to Platina's preferred placement
for roasted meat, we would have liked to have served this dish in the first
course, rather than the second course. Serve the veal later in the feast,
however, did allow us to see how full our feasters were. Though little
veal was returned form the feast hall, feasters with whom we spoke admitted
to being thoroughly full when they had consumed the meat in this course.</font></b>

<p><b><u><font color="#000000">Additional Notes; What We Learned from the

<p><b><font color="#000000">Most people in the U.S. Midwest are unfamiliar
with the concept of spooning a sauce onto a dish. Instead, they are familiar
with ladling sauces or dipping items into sauce. The feast testers unanimously
ignored the sauce at the beginning of the course because it was thick enough
to be unfamiliar to them. The highly colored version of this sauce was
a uniform purplish brown, and rather unattractive to the test feasters.
Once shown what to do with the sauce, the feasters agreed that it was tasty,
but odd, though not unpleasantly so, with a predominately grape taste.</font></b>
<p><b><u><font color="#000000">What We Learned from the Coronation Feast</font></u></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">True to the test feast, few people knew what
to do with the garlic sauce until told by the servers. Surprisingly, very
little was actually returned from the feast hall. Fresh bread crumbs rather
than commercially prepared and dried vastly improve this dish.</font></b>

which doctors say does not nourish the limbs, paves the way to fevers.
Eaten ripe, however, and as a first course, they induce appetite, move
the urine, lubricate the bowels, and remedy bad breath. Dried peaches eaten

<p><b><font color="#000000">Platina firmly believe that despite the Persian
belief that peaches were poisonous, Egyptian sun had rendered peaches palatable
to all men safely. Because of the excessive humours that may have been
produced in this feast from various other dishes, we placed the peaches
at the end of the meal on Platina's suggestion. They serve to close off
the stomach and rebalance any imbalances produced by overindulgence. They
also serve as an excellent follow-up to roasted meat, which Platina claims
should not be scorned because peaches will <i>"cool the opening of the
stomach and the upper orifices"</i> (Milham, pg. 151) especially when served
with very good wine. We serve dried peaches in this feast because of the
time of year; fresh peaches would be unavailable in the spring.</font></b>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Many feasters commented on the fine taste of
the dried, organic peaches we acquired for the feast. Most, however, expressed
regret that they could not eat more by this point in the feast because
they were too full.</font></b>

from the dangerous vapors that might rise from the stomach after indulgence
in roasted meats or fatty foods. Despite its rather lackluster nutritional
value, cheese comes highly recommended by Platina to staunch the ill humours

<p><b><font color="#000000">Gaylin Walli is a technical writer and editor

<p><b><font color="#000000">Jennifer Conrad has been cooking for mumble-teen

<p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Philippa Ferraria (Phillipa Alderton)</u>:</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The butcher for this feast was Philippa "Phlip"
Ferraria. Phlip was born in 453, near the Caucasus Mountains and what is
now known as the Volga River, amongst a group of very tolerant Turkic people
known as the Khazars. The Khazars were reknowned as traders, light mercenary
cavalry, archers, and nomadic horse people. Lacking a son, Phlip's father
taught her at an early age the trade of blacksmithing and the Roman invention
of horseshoes. Since that time, Phlip has learned everything taught to
her about archery, cooking, leather working, medicaments, reading, fighting
(from her mother, of course), and such other skills as she found useful
or interesting.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Philippa Alderton does leatherwork, is a farrier

<p><b><font color="#000000">The test feast participants and the brave souls
who tried versions of the dishes prior to the actual coronation feast deserve
special recognition for courageously confronting food never seen before.
They ate far more of it than expected. The head cook would like to specifically
thank Kamiizumi Jirou Munenori, Lady Alexandria of Roaring Wastes, Sergeant
Valharic Caligula Aurelius, Lord Dougal Ursul Dhu, Lady Arrianna de Claybourne
and several unsuspecting members of House Darkyard for all their assistance.</font></b>
