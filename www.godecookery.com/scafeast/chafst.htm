      </center>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">A Chaucerian Feast was originally
conceived
after I discovered a copy of <i>Pleyn Delit</i>, which lists a menu of
foods from Chaucer's writings. It has been my experience, though, not
to
rely completely on modern interpretations, and so, using <i>Pleyn Delit</i>
as a basis, I decided to research Chaucer and his foods myself. This of
course meant reading practically every work he had written, for
Chaucer,
although we know was an overweight man, was not overly fond of food and
wrote little of the culinary favorites of his day. Bread, ale, and wine
are the most often mentioned, but other foods are not specifically
defined:
roasted meat, drink, etc. If it were not for the inclusion of the cook
in <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, this feast would be a sad one, indeed!
Albert C. Baugh's <i>Chaucer's Major Poetry</i> proved an invaluable
source
for the poetry, for it not only presented his works in the original
language
but also provided an excellent glossary, with the translations of food
references based on the same cookbooks that I was researching. A
wonderful
interlinear translation by Vincent Hopper was also used. After
discovering
all possible food references from Chaucer, I then turned to several
period
cookbooks for further research, trying to stay as closely as possible
to
Chaucer's original intention. My two main sources for this feast were <i>Curye
on Inglish</i> and <i>Two Fifteenth-Century Cookery Books</i>, both
originally
written during or just after Chaucer's lifetime. Only one recipe, the
roasted
pears, came from a different source, that being <i>Chiquart's "On
Cookery,"</i>
from the 14th Century. <i>Pleyn Delit</i> was occasionally consulted,
but
not heavily relied upon.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Here, then, is the food for A
Chaucerian Feast.
May you enjoy, and may sweet dreams be born of your gourmandizing.</font></b>

      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Barley-breed, Broun Breed,
Wastel-bree</u>d
- barley bread, brown bread, &amp; white bread.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Blankmanger</u> - <i>"To make
blaumanger
gros. Tak rys &amp; pike hem &amp; wasch hem &amp; stepe hem &amp;
tempere
hem with good almound melk, &amp; do it in a pot &amp; mak it to sethe

dresch it in disches, &amp; set therin fryed almoundes, &amp; straw
sugre
aboue &amp; serue it forth."</i> - Curye on Inglysch, p. 89.</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Chaucer's cook is an expert at making
blankmanger,
which Hopper translates as "spiced chicken." Judging by the many
versions
of the recipe that appear in period cookbooks, most medieval cooks were
probably at least familiar with this dish. By its strictest definition,
blankmanger is any bland, white pottage based on almond milk, and
(except
for a few fish-day versions) contains ground poultry, thickened with
rice
flour; the standard English flesh-day version was ground capon (or
chicken)
with rice and almond milk. In some recipes the poultry is in chunks,
rather
than ground up- thus "blaumanger gros," gros, of course, being "large"
(<i>Curye on Inglish</i>, 171-172). For this event, the blankmanger was
made according to the instructions in the receipt above, except that
honey
was substituted for the sugar in the final garnish. Today's modern
blancmange
is a type of rice-pudding dessert, much beloved by the English, and
only
bears a slight resemblance to its medieval forerunner.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Mortreux</u> - <i>"Mortrews. Take
hennes
and pork and seeth hem togyder. Take the lyres of hennes and of the
pork
and hewe it small, and grinde it al to doust; take brede y-grated and
do
therto, and temper it with the self broth, and alye it with yolkes of
ayren;
and cast theron powdour fort. Boile it and do therin powdour of gynger,
sugur, safroun and salt, and loke that it be stondyng; and flour it
with
powdour gynger."</i> -Curye on Inglish, p. 107.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Hopper translates mortreux as "stew,"
but a
better definition comes from <i>Curye on Inglish</i>: "a boiled dish
of
finely ground food in broth" (202). <i>Pleyn Delit</i> treats mortreux
as a soup, but also claims that it can be prepared as a pate, which
appears
to be how our medieval cook wishes it done, as we are advised to <i>"loke
that it be stondyng."</i> Other period recipes also imply that the
mixture
is at least slightly thick. The above receipt calls for "powdour fort,"
which <i>Curye on Inglish</i> defines as a mixture of ground spices,
usually
pepper and/or cloves (208). Mortreux is named after the mortar in which
it was prepared.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Wyn</u> - wine.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Bake Mete</u> - <i>"A-nother
manere. Tak
fayre porke y-broylid, &amp; grynd it smal with yolkys of Eyroun; than
take Pepir, Gyngere, &amp; grynd it smal, &amp; melle it with-al, &amp;
a lytel hony, &amp; floryssche thin cofyns with-ynne &amp; with-owte,
&amp;
hele hem with thin ledys, &amp; late hem bake, &amp; serue forth."</i>
-Two Fifteenth-Century Cookbooks, p. 47</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">At first glance, "bake mete" would
appear to
be simply "baked meat," but a closer look brings a different
definition.
Both Baugh and Hopper translate this as "meat pie," and Two
Fifteenth-Century
Cookbooks has an entire section devoted to "Bake Metis,' from which
this
recipe comes. It is a simplified version, or "a-nother manere" of <i>"Tarte
de Charre,"</i> which appears earlier on the same page. For this event
it was prepared exactly as instructed above, with the addition of
currants
and dates, two items which appear in the <i>"Tarte de Charre"</i>
recipe.
Meat pies were a common feature at the Franklin's table, where it <i>"snewed"</i>
meat and drink.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Chicknes with the Marybones</u> - <i>"Schyconys
with the bruesse. Take halfe a dosyn Chykonys, &amp; putte hem in-to a
potte; then putte ther-to a gode gobet of freysshe Beef, &amp; lat hem
boyle wyl; putte ther-to Percely, Sawge leuys, Saurey, noyt to smal
hakkyd;
putte ther-to Safroun y-now; then kytte thin Brewes, &amp; skalde hem
with
the same brothe; Salt it wyl."</i> -Two Fifteenth-Century Cookbooks, p.
32.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Of the many recipes researched for A
Chaucerian
Feast, this is the only one I found in which the chicken is boiled with
the beef, a requirement we must fulfill in order to stay true to
Chaucer's
writing. His cook is proficient at this dish, and it is easy to imagine
him serving it to his employers, the wealthy Guilds men, while on their
merry pilgrimage. The use of marrow bones is common in medieval
cookery,
and for this event, beef shank bones were used, as advised by <i>Pleyn
Delit</i>.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Stubbel Goos with Percely</u> - <i>"Goce
or Capon farced. Take parcill, Swynes grece, or suet of shepe, and
parboyle
hem in faire water and fresssh boyling broth; And then take yolkes of
eyeron
hard y-sodde, and hew hem smale, with the herbes and the salte; and
cast
therto pouder of Ginger, Peper, Canell, and salte, and Grapes in tyme
of
yere; And in other tyme, take oynons, and boile hem; and whan they ben
yboiled ynowe with the herbes and with the suet, al togidre, then put
all
in the goos, or in the Capon; And then late him roste ynough."</i> -
Two
Fifteenth-Century Cookbooks, p. 81.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">The innocent-sounding name of this
dish is
actually a misnomer, for our good friend Roger Hodge the cook is much
berated
by Chaucer's host for preparing his goose in a manner not fit to be
eaten- <i>"Of
many a pilgrym hastow Cristes curs, for of thy percely yet they fare
the
wors, that they have eten with thy stubbel goos; for in thy shoppe is
many
a flye loos."</i> Thus implying that his poor stubble-fed goose has
flies
mixed in with the parsley stuffing! Happily, the flies have been left
out
of "Goce or Capon farced," and the stuffing was made as above, using
both
the grapes and (in honor of the Summoner) the onions.</font></b> </p>
      <p><a name="venysoun"></a><b><font color="#000000"><u>Venysoun</u>
- the
venison for this event was prepared by Patri Cormaker of Afongara,
according
to instructions in <i>Two Fifteenth-Century Cookbooks</i>: <i>"and
roste
hem on a spitte." </i>The<i> </i>whole deer was expertly spit-roasted
all
day and brought steaming into the feast hall, still on the spit, on the
shoulders of two young men.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Wortes</u> - <i>"Buttered Wortes.
Take al
manor of good herbes that thou may gete, and do bi ham as is forsaid;
putte
hem on the fire with faire water; put ther-to clarefied butter a grete
quantite. Whan thei ben boyled ynough, salt hem; late none otemele come
ther-in. Dise brede small in disshes, and powre on the wortes, and
serue
hem forth."</i> -Two Fiftenth-Century Cookbooks, p. 69</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Baugh defines wortes as herbs, and
Chaucer
has his Chanticleer in the <i>Nun's Priest's Tale</i> dream of a sly
"col-fox,"
hiding in a bed of herbs: "And in a bed of wortes stille he lay." But,
to the medieval cook, wortes were more than just the plants we use for
seasonings and spices today, and included such vegetables as cabbage
leaves,
beet greens, borage, parsley, leeks, etc. (<i>Two Fifiteenth-Century
Cookbooks</i>,
69). Namely, any combination of greens and members of the onion family.
For this event, the wortes used were cabbage leaves, spinach, parsley,
various greens, and onions.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Fecches</u> - fecches are vetches,
which
are strictly defined as legumes. But a more loose translation is
"beans,"
which is exactly what Chaucer means when he writes "nought worth two
fecches."
Not worth two beans, in other words. The fecches used for A Chaucerian
Feast are a mixture of both beans and legumes.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Wafres</u> - <i>"Waffres. Take
the Wombe
of A luce, &amp; sethe here wyl, &amp; do it on a morter, &amp; tender
cheese ther-to, grynde hem y-fere; than take flowre an whyte of Eyroun
&amp; bete to-gedere, then take Sugre an pouder of Gyngere, &amp; do al
to-gerderys, &amp; loke that thin Eyroun ben hote, &amp; kley ther-on
of
thin paste, &amp; than make thin waffrys, &amp; serue yn."</i> -Two
Fifteenth-Century
Cookbooks, p. 39.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Wafers were enormously popular in the
Middle
Ages, and resembled our modern waffle. The above receipt has as one of
its main ingredients the womb of a pike, and it is thereby assumed that
this wafer was originally intended to be eaten on a fish-day or during
Lent. Fortunately for our modern tastes, fish womb is not readily
available
at the local supermarket, and these wafers have been prepared,
mercifully,
without.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Peres</u> - <i>"Again, pears
cooked without
coals or water: to instruct the person who will be cooking them, he
should
get a good new earthenware pot, then get the number of pears he will be
wanting to cook and put them into that pot; when they are in it, stop
it
up with clean little sticks of wood in such a way that when the pot is
upside down on the hot coals it does not touch them at all; then turn
it
upside down on the hot coals and keep it covered over with coals and
leave
it to cook for an hour or more. Then uncover them and check whether
they
have cooked enough, and leave them there until they are cooked enough.
When they are cooked, put them out into fine silver dishes; then they
are
borne to the sick person."</i> -Chiquart's 'On Cookery', p. 108.</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">This recipe is much less elaborate
than it
appears, and is simply pears baked in an oven, very much like our
contemporary
baked apple, but without the addition of sugar and spices. Baked pears
must have been considered to have medicinal properties, hence the
instruction
to give them to the sick person, and to a person sick in bed and
suffering
the tortures of the medieval physician, a hot and tender baked pear
must
have had a soothing effect. <i>John Russel's Boke of Nurture</i>
describes
a "Feast fit for a Franklin" which ends with "apples and pears
(possibly
baked)."</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Chese</u> - cheese. Walsh-notes -
walnuts.
Hony - honey. Grapes Whyte and Rede - red &amp; white grapes.</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Gyngebreed</u> - <i>"Gyngerbrede.
Take a
quart of hony, &amp; sethe it, &amp; skeme it clene; take Safroun,
pouder
Pepir, &amp; throw ther-on; take gratyd Brede, &amp; make it so
chargeaunt
that it wol be y-leched; then take pouder Canelle, &amp; straw ther-on
y-now; then make yt square, lyke as thou wolt leche it; take when thou
lechyst hyt, an caste Box leaves a-bouyn, y-stkyd ther-on, on clowys.
And
if thou wolt haue it Red, coloure it with Saunderys y-now."</i> -Two
Fifteenth-Century
Cookbooks, p. 35.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">This recipe is, as W.E. Mead says in <i>The
English Medieval Feast</i>, gingerbread without the ginger. <i>Pleyn
Delit</i>,
however, speaks of the forgetfulness of the scribe who neglected to
include
the ingredient, and therefore includes the spice in its modern version.
Either way, this bears litle similarity to our contemporary
gingerbread,
and is instead more like a confection or candy. It is among the many
sweets
brought to Sir Thopas: <i>"They fette hym first the sweete wyn, and
mede
eek in a mazelyn, and roial spicerye of gyngebreed that was ful fyn,
and
lycorys, and eek comyn, with sugre that is trye."</i></font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Voide</u> - "Wine was drunk before
retiring
in the Middle Ages, accompanied by spices and often cakes, dates, figs,
raisins, etc. The little repast was often called the voide." -Chaucer's
Major Poetry, p. 136</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Claree</u> - <i>"Claree: wine to
which honey
and spices were added."</i> - Chaucer's Major Poetry, p. 266.</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">Claree is known today as claret, and
the claree
for A Chaucerian Feast was made by infusing red wine with honey,
cinnamon,
and cloves.</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000"><u>Cake</u> - <i>"Bryndons. Take
Wyn, &amp;
putte in a potte, an clarifyd hony, an Saunderys, pepir, Safroun,
Clowes,
Maces, &amp; Quybibys, &amp; mynced Datys, Pynys and Roysonys of

-Two Fifteenth-Century Cookbooks, p. 15</font></b> </p>
      <p><b><font color="#000000">When Chaucer mentions cake in <i>The
Canterbury
Tales</i>, and he does several times, he is referring to a type of flat
round loaf of sweet bread, not the "cakys" of above. These little
strips
of pastry could in no way be the large round cake that the Summoner's
buckler
imitates, but the temptation to serve this treat, which contains all
the
elements of Baugh's voide (wine, spices, dates, figs, and raisins)
proved
too strong.</font></b> </p>
