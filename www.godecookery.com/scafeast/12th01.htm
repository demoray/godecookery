<p><b><i><font color="#000000">202. Crespes grandes et petites. Large and
Small Crepes. The large ones are made with a syrup pot or a large brass
pan, the small ones with an iron pan. They should be made of egg yolks
and flour beaten together. get a deep wooden bowl and hot grease, put the
batter in the bowl -- it should not be too thick -- turn your hand in the
bowl over the hot grease; and keep them from browning too much. For Small
Crepes you should beat yolks and whites together with flour, and it should
be a little thicker than the batter for the Large Crepes. Keep a low fire
going until (the grease is) hot; get a wooden bowl with a hole in the bottom,
put the batter in it and then when everything is ready let it run out and
make a sort of little loop, or a larger one, and across the loop make a
sort of tongue of a buckle with the same batter; and let the Crepes cook
in the grease until they have swollen up.</font></i></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#000000">154. D'autres menuz potaiges...: Other Lesser
Pottages, such as stewed chard, cabbage, turnip greens, leeks, veal in
Yellow Sauce, and plain shallot pottage, peas, frenched beans, mashed beans,
sieved beans or beans in their shell, pork offal, brewet of pork tripe
-- women are experts with these and anyone knows how to do them; as for
tripe, which I have not put in my recipe book, it is common knowledge how
it is to be eaten.</font></i></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#000000">177. (Clary Fritters): Take the herb called
clary and grind it, steep it in pure water and beat well sieved flour into
this; add in some honey and a little white wine and beat these together
until smooth; then fry small spoonfuls of this mixture in oil, as is done
for fritters, and put rosemary generously on each fritter; squeeze your
fritters between two blades to drain off the oil, then put them in a fine
new pot beside the fire. Dress them on a plate with sugar.</font></i></b>

grapes, boiled almond milk, cracknels, galettes and white bread crusts
cut into small cubes and boil these last items in your milk, with saffron
to give it colour, and sugar, and set all of this to boil until it is thick
enough to slice. Set it out in bowls.</font></i></b>

<p><b><i><font color="#000000">175. (Pies of Herbs, Cheese, and Eggs):
Take parsley, mint, chard, spinach, lettuce, marjoram, basil and wild thyme,
and grind everything together in a mortar, moisten with pure water and
squeeze out the juice; break a large number of eggs into the juice and
add powdered ginger, cinnamon and long pepper, a good quality cheese, grated,
and salt; beat everything together. Then make very thin pastry to put in
your dish, of the size of your dish, and then line your dish with it; coat
the inside of the dish with pork fat, then put in your pastry, put your
dish on the coals and again coat the inside of the pastry with pork fat;
when it has melted, put your filling in your pastry and cover it with the
other dish and put fire on top as well as underneath and let your pie dry
out a little; uncover the top of the dish and put five egg yolks and fine
spice powder carefully over your pie; then replace the dish as it was before
and let it gradually cook in a low coal fire; check often to see that it
is not overcooking. Put sugar over the top when serving it.</font></i></b>
