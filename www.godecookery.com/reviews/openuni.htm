gentle simmer.</b>

the meat is tender. Then add the salt and wine vinegar.</b>

lay them on top, and decorate the edges with the pieces of bread. Then

      <p><b>Richard Fitch: No. The thing you have to realise is the
limited quantity
and availability of seasoning at the time. A small amount of salt, a
very
expensive commodity then, would have been added toward the end of the
cooking
process. The most common seasoning in Britain in the Middle Ages was
mustard.
Pepper was also used, but to give you an idea of how precious it was,
in
a household of 20 staff consumption of pepper would have been less than
a quarter of a teaspoon per person per week!</b></p>

The kind
of things they didn&#8217;t have would have been imports from the New World
and
the Americas. In the 15th century and earlier, vegetables were seen as
the preserve of the poor. The rich, if they did cook vegetables, would
have boiled them to death and thrown away the water, losing all their
goodness.</b> </p>
      <p><b>What we also find 400 years ago is that we were very
reliant on what
we&#8217;d stored over the winter. The household would have smoked a large
amount
of meat &#8211; slaughtering the pigs in the autumn, keeping a little bit of
fresh meat, but preserving as much as possible as it had to last all
the
way through until the next year.</b></p>

recipes
at the time. All they had was their fields, their gardens &#8211; food and
medicine
went hand in hand, and people were using food and herbs to treat
infection
from Roman times right up to the middle ages. People then thought there
were four humours which were responsible for health in the body &#8211;
blood,
black bile, yellow bile and phlegm. You stayed healthy as long as those
four humours were in balance.</b>
      <p><b>Gordon: So which herbs do what? Andrew, if I had an upset
stomach,
how would I have been treated?</b> </p>
      <p><b>Andrew Chevallier: That would be too much yellow or black
bile. Globe
artichoke is very good to protect the liver and lower blood fat levels.
Sage is very good for digestion and helps to strengthen the stomach&#8217;s
action.</b></p>

chest
and soothes dry, irritating, tickly coughs. Garlic as everyone will
know
is a natural antibiotic and is very good for chest infections.</b>

best
known as a culinary plant these days &#8211; but its also a good invigorating
tonic and promotes energy. If you&#8217;re full of nervous energy it&#8217;ll help
