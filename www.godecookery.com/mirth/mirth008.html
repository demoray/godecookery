      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>A
Faire Chyne of Beefe was once given to Mr. <i>John Fletcher</i>, (the
poet)
he pray'd his Hostesse, (being an old woman neere the Bank-side, where
he lodged) to salt it well seven or eight daies, and he would invite
some
friends to the eating of it: the day being come, and the Chine at the
Fire,
the Woman had not playd the Huswife so well in salting of it, but that
it had taken Ayre, and entertain'd more Tenants than were welcome: but
after it had been three houres at the fire, Master <i>Fletcher</i> had
a minde to have a slice hot from the spit, and for that purpose came
downe
from his Chamber, drew his knife, and cut; and as hee cut, hee espyed
Maggots
drop out, at which hee was angry, but suffering the Spit to goe about,
hee cut on the other side, and found it worse: Whereupon <i>Fletcher</i>
being alone, (for the Woman was gone forth, and left the Jacke to looke
to the Spit) was so enraged, that hee tooke the spit up, and setting
his
foot against the meate, footed it off, and threw it into a muddy ditch
on the other side of the way, and putting the Spit into the Jacke-rope
againe, went up to his Chamber againe in a chafe: the old woman
suddainly
comming in, and seeing the meate gone, was amazed, and stept into the
streete,
and asked some of her neighbours, if they saw any body goe into her
house?
one made answer, that Mr. <i>Fletcher</i> went over to the Ditch, and
backe
againe, but he saw nobody else, then the woman went to see, and she
perceived
the mudde was newly inclosed over something that had been cast therein
lately: So she fetcht a Rake, and raked the Beefe out of the ditch, put
it under a Pumpe, and with a wispe, ashes, and sand, wash'd and
scower'd
it, so that all the Gentiles in it were confounded, then to the Spit
shee
put it againe, winds up the Jacke, which made a noise in his language <i>whir
whir</i>; which Mr. <i>Fletcher</i> hearing, mused what was provided
for
his Guests and himselfe; the old woman being gone into her back-side, <i>Fletcher</i>
stole softly downe the stayres, and peeping towards the fire, saw the
Chine
a roasting the second time, at which amazement hee blest himselfe,
saying, <i>Art
thou crawl'd thither againe, thou shalt never be remov'd for me againe</i>:
so it was roasted, and gave good content to the Guests, but some of
them
said, it had taken winde.</b></div>
