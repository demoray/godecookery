      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Three Gentlemen of the
ancient race of <i>Redsbanks</i>, (now called <i>Highland-men</i>,
because they inhabite in the Mountaynous parts of the North of <i>Scotland</i>)
these three having occasion to come into <i>England</i>, being at
their
Inne, had to their Dinner a peece of powderd Beefe and Mustard: now
neither
of them had never seene Mustard before, wherefore one of them demanded
what Deele it was? the Host answered, that it was good sawce for their
meate; Sawce said the other? it hath an ill looke, I pray let me see
you
eat some first, then the Host took a bit of Beefe, and dipt it in the
Mustard,
&amp; did eate it: the Highland-man presently tooke his meat and rowl'd
it in the Mustard, and began to chaw, but it was so strong, that it was
no sooner in his mouth, but it set him a snuffing and neesing, that he
told his Friends, (<i>Ducan</i> and <i>Donald</i>) that hee was slaine
with the grey Grewall in the wee-dish; he bid them draw their
Whineards,
and sticke the false Lowne, (their host) hee pray'd them to remember
his
last love to his wife and Barnes, and withall to have a care to beware
of the grey grewall, for the Deele was in't. But after the force of the
Mustard was spent, the Gentleman left neesing, all was pacified, mine
Host
was pardoned, and Mustard was good sawce for powderd Beefe.</b></div>
