of foure Gentlemen being merry with drinke and discourse in a Taverne,
a Musitian proffer'd them Musicke, which was deny'd, within a little
time
after another ask'd the same question, Gentlemen, will you have any
Musicke?
The Gentlemen began to bee angry, saying, they were Musick to
themselves,
and of themselves, and bad the Fidler get him gone, but it was not long
before the third Fidler opened their doore, and peep'd into the Roome,
with the old note, Gentlemen, will you have any Musicke, a new Song, or
a fine Lesson? The Gentlemen perceiving that no deniall would satisfie
their intruding importunacy, said, do'st thou heare fellow, how many
are
you? Wee are foure said the Musitian; Can you dance said the Gentlemen?
Yes sir said the other; thats well quoth the Gentlemen: so without any
more bidding, the Musitians entred, and two of them plaid, and the
other
two danc'd foure or five Dances; in conclusion the Gentlemen call'd for
a reckoning, and paid it; but as they were going away, one of the
Fidlers
said, Gentlemen, I pray you to remember the Musick, you have given us
nothing
yet; to whom one of the Gentlemen answer'd, nor will we give you any
thing,
for we never knew any Reason to the contrary, But alwayes those that
dance
must pay the Musicke.</b></div>
