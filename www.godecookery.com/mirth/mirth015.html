      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>A
Gentleman that dwelt tenne miles from <i>London</i>, sent his Footman
in
all haste to the Citty, to tell a Merchant welcome newes of a rich
Unkle
of his lately dead, that had left him somewhat to make him merry for
his
Death, with an out-side mourning in Blacke, and an in-side laughing
with
Sacke. The Foot-man having his Message, with a Letter, made as much
speed
as hee could, in hope of Reward for his good tidings, so that he seem'd
by his pace to have wings on his heeles, and by the fogge or sweate hee
was in, you would have suppos'd him to have beene bloated or stewed
body
and bones.</b></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Being come to the Merchant,
hee deliver'd the Letter, which after
he had halfe read, the Contents contented him so, that he called his
Maid,
commanding her to fill a Bowle of Beere, and give it to the Foot-man,
(who
stood dropping with sweate as if he had newly beene duck'd) but hee
setting
it to his mouth, swallowed it with extreame eagernesse, and finding by
the taste that it was a poore mortified Liquor, having no vivacity left
in it, but meerely cold, comfortlesse, and at the best, a poore decayed
single-soal'd drinke, although it were dead, and a deceased remnant of
humidious Aquacity, nay though it had not upon the death or departure
from
its Cinnicall or Diogenicall habitation given so much as a good
rellish,
a smacke, or a taste to the poore Foot-man, that ever any Malt had
beene
drown'd, drench'd, or imbrew'd into it, yet hee (as a man of milde
temper)
amidst his heate, unwilling to speake ill of the dead, did plainely
tell
the Merchant thus: Sir, I doe thinke that your Beere hath ran as fast
as
I have ran, and faster. Why sayst thou so? (quoth the Merchant) because
said the other, it sweates more then I do: it cannot be said the
Marchant:
the foote-man replied that if it did not sweate, he was much deceived,
for hee was sure it was in a cold sweate, or all of a water.</b><b></b>
