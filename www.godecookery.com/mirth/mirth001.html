      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The
Kings-Head Taverne in Fleet-street, at Chancery-lane end, hath a long
time
bin a contenting well-custom'd House, and if the Travailes of some of
the
Drawers up and downe the staires could be measured, it may be reckoned
a dayly journey of Forty miles a day in a Terme-time.</b></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
About 30 Yeeres since there was a man that kept the said Taverne,
whose Name was<i> Gent</i>, who was an honest fat man, (as most fat men
be) who being in bed, about mid-night the Drawers and the Maids were up
merry in the Kitchin, to have a little recreation after their long
dayes
toyle: for which purpose the Maides had made a great and a good Posset,
which exceeding hot, and well sack'd, sugar'd, and spic'd, was put into
a broadbrim'd pewtwr Bason: Mr. <i>Gent</i> being suddainly taken with
an occasion to rise, (for the keeping of his bed cleane) put on his
slippers,
and as he was comming downe the staires, his servants hearing him, were
in doubt they were discovered by their Master, whom to prevent, they
put
out the light, and one of them took the Bason with the hot Posset, and
(to hide it) laid it upon the seat in the House of office, Master <i>Gent</i>
suspecting no harme, went thither in the darke, and set himselfe in the
Posset, which hee found so scalding, that hee cried out Helpe, helpe,
the
devil's in the Privie: thus was the Servants deceiv'd, the Good-man
scar'd
and scalded, and the Posset most unluckily spoyl'd and defil'd.</b></div>
