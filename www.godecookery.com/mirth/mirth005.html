brag'd and boasted that when he was married, that he had at least two
hundred
Cookes to dresse his Wedding Dinner: Another answered him that hee
believed
him not, because he knew that he had not so much as a House to put his
Head in, but lodged in a Garret, and therefore he could not have use or
roome for so many Cookes: He replied, that as hee with his friends came
from Church, they went to a drie Hedge, and set it on fire, (every man
having a piece of Cheese in his pocket,) and dividing themselves, the
one
halfe halfe of them on one side of the Hedge, and the other halfe on
the
other, and so toasting their Cheese, being two hundred in number, they
were all Cookes, and drest the Wedding dinner.</b></div>
