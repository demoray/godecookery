      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The
good, old, and truely right Honourable <i>Charles</i> Earle of <i>Nottingham</i>,
Lord High Admirall of <i>England</i>, whose renowned memory shall nver
bee forgotten untill his bounteous Houskeeping bee generally imitated.
He being at his House at <i>Chelsey</i>, and looking upon certaine
Fishermen
that were fishing in the <i>Thames</i> with their Salmon-Net, his
Lordship
call'd to them, and said, My friends, if you take a Salmon, and bring
him
a shoare living, that I may see it move, and live, I will give you your
price for it: The Fisherman answer'd, (My good Lord) I hope wee shall
bee
able to present your Honour with such a Fish as you desire; so they
drew
their Net to Land, and caught a very faire Salmon. (My Lord standing on
the Land looking on them) To whom the Fisherman said, my Lord, I have
him,
and you shall have him straite: So the poore man tooke off his
leather-girdle,
which had fastned to it a little Pouch, with ten pence in money in it,
and as he had put the girdle through the gill of the Salmon to hold it
the faster, the Fish being a strong lively fish, gave a suddaine flirt
or spring out of the mans armes into the River againe with the girdle
in
the gill, and the Pouch with ten-pence; which Salmon did shoote up the
River the same Tide, from <i>Chelsey</i> to <i>Hammersmith</i>, and
there
it was taken by another Fisherman, and the Girdle with the pouch with
it,
which was restor'd to the right owner, and the Fisherman contentedly
rewarded
for the same by the bounteous Noble-man afore-named.</b></div>
