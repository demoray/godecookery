Gentleman dwelt two miles from a Market-towne, where (at a Taverne) hee
caused some bottles of Wine to be fill'd to carry home, because he had
invited some friends to his house to eate a Venison Pasty with him the
next day: but his man and himselfe dranke so hard, that they forgot
their
Liquor, (I meane the Bottles.) The next day being come, and Dinner
ready
to be laid on the Table, they remembered the Wine; so the Gentleman
commanded
his man to take a Horse, (which was sadled in the Stable) and to ride
for
the Wine with all speed. Well, to Dinner they went, and the Serving-man
to the Stable, the Pasty was opened, and to't they fell, and after an
Houres
time expecting the Wine, now sayd the Gentleman, methinks my man is
riding
hither in post, I heare the Horse dash; at which words the fellow
entred:
Hah well said, art thou come said the Master? we have stay'd long, and
thou hast made but slow speed; a poxe on't said the Fellow, if I should
bee hang'd I cannot finde the bridle.</b></div>
