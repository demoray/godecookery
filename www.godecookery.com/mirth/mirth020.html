      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Being
a merry composed jest of Five Taylors that had been at work till their
Wages came to 5 pounds, likewise a merry conceited Cook-maid that lived
in the house, went to her Master and desired him to lend her a horse,
and
she would venture her skill to take the 5-pound from these five
Taylors,
without either Sword or Pistol, in a jesting way, to make her Master
some
sport and to show her valour: her Master loving mirth more than
sadness,
agreed to it: so a Horse was sadled, and other things to disguise her
self,
because she might not be known: away she went (it being in the Evening)
and met them before they got home, with nothing in her hand but a black
pudding, the faint-hearted Taylors delivered her their money very
quietly,
for fear they should have been shot through with a Black pudding, and
what
followed after is expressed in this following Ditty. Tune is, <font

and torn.</font> With Alloywance.</b></div>

      <p><b>I'lle tell you a pretty fine jest,</b> <br>
      <b>if that you do please it to hear,</b> <br>
      <b>For the truth on't I do protest,</b> <br>
      <b>I'm sure that you need not to fear:</b> <br>
      <b>It is of a valiant Cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>that lived at a Nobleman's place,</b> <br>
      <b>And five Taylor's that once was afraid,</b> <br>
      <b>when as they lookt her in the face;</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>This Noble-man upon a time,</b> <br>
      <b>had great store of work for to do,</b> <br>
      <b>But to bring every thing into rhime,</b> <br>
      <b>'twill study my brains you must know,</b> <br>
      <b>Five Taylors that lived hard by,</b> <br>
      <b>That worked for fourpence a day,</b> <br>
      <b>For Beef and for Pudding at night,</b> <br>
      <b>they'd better do so then to play:</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>These Taylors a great while did work,</b> <br>
      <b>two Masters, and their three men,</b> <br>
      <b>They laboured as hard as a Turk,</b> <br>
      <b>with Stitching both too and agen,</b> <br>
      <b>And when that their work it was done,</b> <br>
      <b>their money unto them was told,</b> <br>
      <b>Full five good pounds it is known,</b> <br>
      <b>of Silver, but not of red Gold:</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>And when as their money they'd got,</b> <br>
      <b>then who was so jocond as they</b> <br>
      <b>Each Man of the best drank his pot,</b> <br>
      <b>and homewards they straight took their way.</b> <br>
      <b>A Cook-maid there was in the house,</b> <br>
      <b>that us'd full merry to be,</b> <br>
      <b>Who went to her Master in haste,</b> <br>
      <b>and these words unto him did say,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Master if that you please,</b> <br>
      <b>some pastime I for you will make,</b> <br>
      <b>But to lend me a horse then (quoth she)</b> <br>
      <b>and this money I from them will take,</b> <br>
      <b>Her Master then hearing the jest,</b> <br>
      <b>would try what this Cook-maid could do</b> <br>
      <b>Some mirth he did think it the best,</b> <br>
      <b>as Gentlemen will do you know,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>A horse then was sadled with speed,</b> <br>
      <b>and boots and Spurs she put on,</b> <br>
      <b>And other materials most fit,</b> <br>
      <b>because that she would not be known,</b> <br>
      <b>A horse-back she straight got astride,</b> <br>
      <b>with a Hogs-Pudding in her hand,</b> <br>
      <b>And meeting these Taylors in haste,</b> <br>
      <b>she presently bid them to stand,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Deliver your Money (quoth she)</b> <br>
      <b>or else your manhoods now try,</b> <br>
      <b>Or by this same thing in my hand,</b> <br>
      <b>every man of you shall dye,</b> <br>
      <b>Then out her Black-pudding she pull'd,</b> <br>
      <b>which sore did the Taylors affright,</b> <br>
      <b>They thought it had been a pistol well charg'd</b> <br>
      <b>because 'twas late in the night.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>They beg'd their lives she might save,</b> <br>
      <b>we are but poor taylors (quoth they)</b> <br>
      <b>And truly no money we have,</b> <br>
      <b>for we work but for four-pence a day,</b> <br>
      <b>You lye like all Rogues (quoth she)</b> <br>
      <b>and do not my patience provoke,</b> <br>
      <b>For 5 pounds you have tane for your work.</b> <br>
      <b>so presant that worddid them choak,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>That money deliver with speed,</b> <br>
      <b>if that you think well on your Lives,</b> <br>
      <b>Or by this same thing you shall bleed,</b> <br>
      <b>the which will go farther then knives,</b> <br>
      <b>Then out of their pockets their money they took</b> <br>
      <b>with many a sorrowful tear,</b> <br>
      <b>and gave it into her hand,</b> <br>
      <b>here's all on't each Taylor did swear.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>And when she their money had got,</b> <br>
      <b>she set Spurs and away she did run,</b> <br>
      <b>The Davil go with you (quoth they)</b> <br>
      <b>for i'me sure that we are undone:</b> <br>
      <b>But when that this Cook-maid came home,</b> <br>
      <b>strait unto her Master she told,</b> <br>
      <b>And show'd him his money again,</b> <br>
      <b>how passages went she did unfold,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>But here comes the cream of the jest,</b> <br>
      <b>those Taylors which was such Men,</b> <br>
      <b>After they'd stood pausing a while,</b> <br>
      <b>then back they returned again,</b> <br>
      <b>They came with a pittiful tone,</b> <br>
      <b>their hair stood like men bewitcht</b> <br>
      <b>To'th Gentleman they made their moan,</b> <br>
      <b>for their mony their fingers it itcht,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>The Gentleman laugh'd inconceit,</b> <br>
      <b>how many was there said he,</b> <br>
      <b>Sure you were all men sufficient</b> <br>
      <b>to a beaten above two or three;</b> <br>
      <b>Truly we saw but one man</b> <br>
      <b>the which took our money away,</b> <br>
      <b>But we feared he had partakers in store,</b> <br>
      <b>or else he should never a carried the day.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>He was well mounted upon a good steed,</b> <br>
      <b>and a Pistol that put us to studying,</b> <br>
      <b>You lye like all fools (quoth she)</b> <br>
      <b>it was but a black Hogs-Pudding:</b> <br>
      <b>Thus the poor Taylors did jeer</b> <br>
      <b>and the Cook-maid laugh'd in conceit,</b> <br>
      <b>That with nothing but a black Pudding,</b> <br>
      <b>and that five Taylors should beat,</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>The straightaway the Gentleman spoke,</b> <br>
      <b>what will you give then (said he)</b> <br>
      <b>To have all your money again,</b> <br>
      <b>and the face on't once more to see:</b> <br>
      <b>Quoth the Taylors we'l give the ton half,</b> <br>
      <b>and that's very fair you do know,</b> <br>
      <b>Altho' that we were such fools,</b> <br>
      <b>to part with our good silver so.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>The straitways he call'd for the Cook,</b> <br>
      <b>then the Taylors did laugh in their sleeve</b> <br>
      <b>And set her to cunjuring strait,</b> <br>
      <b>which made the poor Taylors believe</b> <br>
      <b>That she by her art had it found,</b> <br>
      <b>and show'd them the place where it lay,</b> <br>
      <b>Which made the poor Taylors to smile,</b> <br>
      <b>so merry and jocand was they.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>Here take half the money said they,</b> <br>
      <b>the which we did promise to you,</b> <br>
      <b>And for you we ever will pray,</b> <br>
      <b>for such Cook-Maids there is but a few,</b> <br>
      <b>I'le have none of your money she said,</b> <br>
      <b>as sure as i'me hear alive,</b> <br>
      <b>One may know what Cowards you are,</b> <br>
      <b>to let a Hogs-Pudding to fright you all</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
      <b>without either Pistol or Gun,</b> <br>
      <b>But with a Black-pudding did fright,</b> <br>
      <b>five Taylors, and put them to 'th run.</b> </p>
      <p><b>And thus the old Proverb is true,</b> <br>
      <b>nine Taylors do make but one man</b> <br>
      <b>And now it doth plainly appear,</b> <br>
      <b>let them all do what they can,</b> <br>
      <b>for had they been stout hearted Lads,</b> <br>
      <b>they need not called for aid,</b> <br>
      <b>Nor afraid to tast of a Pudding,</b> <br>
      <b>nor yet be'n out-brav'd by a Maid.</b> </p>
      <p><b>O this was the valiant cook-maid,</b> <br>
