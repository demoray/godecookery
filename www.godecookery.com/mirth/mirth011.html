      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>Simon Wadle</i>, a Vintner,
(that once kept the Taverne neere
the <i>Temple-barre</i>, at the Signe of <i>Saint Dunstane</i>) with
some
other Vintners, had been to taste and buy Wines at the Merchants, and
having
done their occasions, happened into the three Tunnes at <i>Garlike-bithe</i>,
where all the meate they could have on the suddaine, was a pound of
Sawsadges; <i>Wadle</i>
being hungry, had no great stomacke to have so many partners in so
small
a dish, and having an old rotten Tooth in his pocket, (which a Barbar
in
Fleet-streete had drawne from him the day before) hee secretly
convey'd,
and thrust the said Tooth into one of the Sawsadges, which he himselfe
first tooke into his hand; and after his associates had each one tasted
a little, and began to bee quicke and nimble, <i>Wadle</i> snap'd his
old
tooth in his chaps, and pulling it forth, shewed it to the company,
upon
the sight whereof they were all struck with feare and amazement,
beleeving
by the Tooth, that the Sawsages had beene made of Mans flesh: so they
call'd
for Sacke and Sallet-oyle, supposing they had beene poysoned; but <i>Wadle</i>
fell to with a good stomacke, saying that hee could be no worse
poysened
with them than hee was: The man of the house vowed that the murderous
Jade
that made the Sawsages, should be burnt. But after <i>Wadle</i> had
eaten
up all, hee sent for the Barbar that drew the Tooth, and every man was
presently cured, and the Sawsage-woman escaped burning.</b><b></b> </p>
