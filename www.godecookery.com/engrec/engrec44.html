<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> A recipe for a honey drink</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b>Weak Honey-drink.</b>
<p><b>Take nine parts of warm fountain-water, and dissolve in it one pint
of pure white Honey, by laving it therein, till it be dissolved. Then boil
it gently, skimming it all the while, till all the scum be perfectly scummed
off; and after that boil it a little longer, peradventure a quarter of
an hour. In all it will require two or three hours of boiling, so that
at last one third part may be consumed. About a quarter of an hour before
you cease boiling, and take it from the fire, put to it a little spoonful
of cleansed and sliced Ginger; and almost half as much of the thin yellow
rhind of Orange, when you are even ready to take it from the fire, so as
the Orange boil only one walm in it. Then pour it into a well-glased strong
deep great gally-pot, and let it stand so, till it be almost cold, that
it be scarce lukewarm. Then put to it a little spoonful of pure Ale-yeast,
and work it together with a ladle to make it ferment: as soon as it beginneth
to do so, cover it close with a fit cover, and put a thick doubled woolen
cloth about it. Cast all things so that this may be done when you are going
to bed. Next morning when you rise, you will find the barm gathered all
together in the middle; scum it clean off with a silver spoon and a feather,
and bottle up the liquor, stopping it very close. It will be ready to drink
in two or three days; but it will keep well a month or two. It will be
from the first very quick and pleasant.</b></td>
