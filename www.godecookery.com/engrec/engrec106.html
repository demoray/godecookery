<p><b><font size=+2>Potage of Venison</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>PERIOD:</font> England, 17th century | <font size=-1>SOURCE:

English and French Cook, 1674 | <font size=-1>CLASS:</font> Authentic</b>

<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b>Potage of Venison.</b>
<p><b>Take a Haunch of Venison, and cut it into six pieces, and place them
in the bottom of a Pan or Pot, then put in no more Water than will cover
it, let it boil, then scum it, after that add to it a good quantity of
whole Pepper; when it is half boiled, put in four whole Onions, Cloves,
and large Mace, some sliced Ginger, Nutmeg, three or four faggots of sweet
Herbs, let it boil till the Venison be very tender, and a good part of
the broth be wasted; after this pour out the broth from the meat into a
Pipkin, keep your Venison hot in the same Pot by adding other hot broth
unto it; then take a couple of red-Beet roots, having very well parboil'd
them before, cut them into square pieces as big as a shilling, and put
them into the broth which is in your Pipkin, and let them boil till they
are very tender, add unto the boiling four Anchovies minced, then dish
up your Venison on Sippets of French-bread, then pour on your broth, so
much as will near-upon fill the Dish, then take your roots by themselves,
and toss them in a little drawn Butter, and lay them all over the Venison;
if the Beets be good, it will make the broth red enough, which you must
have visible round about the Dish sides, but if it prove pale, put to it
some Saunders: This is a very savory Potage.</b></td>
