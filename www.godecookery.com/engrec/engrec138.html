Cookery, 1675 | <font size=-1>CLASS:</font> Authentic</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> A stew of beef, lamb, veal, &amp;
poultry with vegetables &amp; herbs</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b>To make a good Spanish Olio.</b>
<p><b>Take a Rump of Beef, or some of a Brisket or Buttock, cut it to pieces;
a Loyn of Mutton with the Fat taken off, and a fleshy piece of a Leg of
Veal, or a Knuckle, a piece of inter-larded Bacon, three or four Onions,
or some Garlick, and if you will, a Capon or two, or else three great Tame-Pigeons.
First, put into the water the Beef and Bacon, after a while the Mutton,
Veal, and Onions, but not the Capon or Pigeons, only so long till they
are boyled enough; if you have Garavanza's, put them in at the first, after
they have been soaked with Ashes all night in heat, wash them well in warm
water; or if you have Cabbage, Roots, Leeks, or whole Onions, put them
in time enough to be sufficiently boyled. You may at first put in some
Crusts of Bread, or Venison Pye-Crust; it must boyl in all five or six
hours gently, like stewing; after it is well boyled, a quarter, or half
an hour before you intend to take it, take out a porringer full of Broath,
and put to it some Pepper, and five or six Cloves, and a Nutmeg, and some
Saffron, and mingle them well in it, then put that into the Pot, and let
it boyl, or stew wuth the rest a while, put in a bundle of sweet Herbs,
salt must be put in when it is scumm'd.</b></td>
