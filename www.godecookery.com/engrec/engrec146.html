<p><b>To make Paste of Pippins, after the Genua fashion, some like leaves,
some like Plums, with stalkes and stones.</b>
<p><b>Take and pare faire yellow Pippins, cut them in small pieces, stew
them betwixt two dishes with two or three spoonefuls of Rosewater, and
when they be boiled very tender, straine them then boile the weight of
the pulp in double refined Sugar vnto a Candie height, and if you please
put in a graine of Muske, and a quarter of an ounce of fine white ginger
searced, and so let it boile vntill you see it come from the bottome of
the Posnet, then fashion it on a sheete of glasse in some prettie forme
as you thinke best, and stoue it either in a Stoue, or in a warme Ouen.
If you desire to haue any of it red, colour it with a spoonefull of Conserue
of Damsons, before you fashion it vpon your glasse or plate, and that will
make shew as though it were made of red Plums. If you put a stone betwixt
two halfes, will shew like a Plum, you may keepe Cherrie stalkes drie for
the same purpose.</b></td>
