<p><b><font size=+2>About This Translation</font></b>
<p><b>This is still VERY MUCH a work in progress, though much has been
accomplished. I am working with facsimiles of the original <i>MS</i>, transcribing
the original Middle English receipts then translating each into 2 different
modern English versions and 1 modern recipe, sans measurements and cooking
times. I'm also cross-referencing both notes &amp; receipts with other
period collections, most notably the <i>Harleian Manuscripts</i> &amp;
those in <i>Curye on Inglisch</i>.</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>This is the online version of this work.</font> I'll
be seeking eventual publication after it is completed, and will include
modern "redactions," i.e. fully workable recipes, more detailed notes &amp;
commentaries, and a complete glossary with the off-line, finished version.
<font size=+1>Publishers
take note:</font> any publisher interested in this new translation of <i>MS
Pepys 1047</i> should <font size=+1>please</font> feel free to contact
me!</b>
<p><b>The <i>Pepys Manuscript</i> was translated in its entirety in Gerald
Hodgett's <i>Stere Htt Well</i> (1972). Why this new translation, then?
My work on the <i>Pepys MS</i> has shown me that Hodgett's work is not
only incomplete &amp; misleading, but often inaccurate. He mistranslates
several important and common words, such as <i>myad</i> (he translates
this as a loaf of bread, &amp; not crumbled bread or bread crumbs), and
shows a tendency to misread the scribe's handwriting. This is most obvious
in his title, <i>Stere Htt Well</i>. At first glance, the scribe does appear
to be spelling the second word with two t's when it is used in the <i>MS</i>;
however, once one becomes familiar with this person's rather unique style
of writing, it is extremely apparent that nowhere is this word spelled
with two t's. It is consistently and always spelled "hit." The phrase Hodgett
uses for his book title, when it appears in the <i>MS</i>, is actually
written "stere hit well." (See recipe #5: To make Creme of Almoundes.)</b>
<p><b>Although this may seem a minor fault to anyone not a purist in this
field, Hodgett also misreads the title of one recipe, seeing "dorre" as
either "sorce" or "sowce." (The scribe's handwriting makes these words
look nearly identical). Hodgett, obviously unfamiliar with other period
culinary receipts, doesn't notice that this is a "dorre" recipe nearly
identical to ones in the <i>Harleian Manuscripts</i>.</b>
<p><b>Hodgett also seems to have little knowledge of actual medieval cooking.
His foreword, by Delia Smith, perpetuates many of the old misconceptions
about medieval food:</b>
<blockquote><b>There is the same wanton infusion of herbs and spices, the
same obsession with almonds, the same mistrust of fresh fruit.... Instead
we find repeated instructions for making the unpalatable at least edible....
the totally indiscriminate use of spices and herbs.... It is commonly thought
that such heavy seasoning was essential to disguise the smell and flavour
of decaying flesh.... It would be a brave housewife today who decided on
the spur of the moment to rustle up a few typically medieval dishes for
a special occasion.</b></blockquote>
<b>This new translation of <i>MS Pepys 1047</i> includes only the culinary
recipes and none of the medical advice, remedies, &amp; instructions in
hawking that make up much of the original manuscript.</b>
<p><b>The <i>MS</i> was written during the reign of Edward IV and was probably
compiled by the time of Henry VII. It entered the collection of the English
writer, Samuel Pepys, in 1700, three years before his death and is found
today in the <a href="http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/pepys/contents.html">Pepys
Library</a> in Cambridge.</b></td>
