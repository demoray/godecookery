<p><b>(2) Capons in golden almond milk <font color="#FF6666">(3.1)</font>.</b>
<p><b>Take blanched almonds and grind them; mix them with water and make
a good almond milk. Strain it, place in a pot, and color with saffron.
Add sugar and salt and place on the fire (put on the stove). Stir it well
and bring to a boil; add a little wine and remove from heat. Take white
bread, slice it in small thin pieces <font color="#FF6666">(3.2)</font>,

brown. Dip the bread pieces in wine and grill again. Pour a little of the

3-4 pieces of the grilled toast on top, then cover with additional milk.
Serve.</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6666">(3.1)</font><font color="#000000"> <i>dorre</i>
- a dorre, or dorry, was almond milk colored yellow, sometimes with a coloring
agent but often with just the burnt crumbs of the <i>brewes</i>; the word
is a derivative of endored. See Hieatt, <i>Curye on Inglisch</i>, p. 215</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6666">(3.2) </font><i>brewes</i> - small, thin pieces
of bread, usually toasted dark brown, and placed in the bottom of a dish
and covered with other foods or sauces. <i>Brewes</i> are one of the main
ingredients in the many "soppes dorre" recipes found in period manuscripts.
Compare the line mentioning <i>brewes</i> in the Pepys receipt with these
from the <i>Harleian Manuscripts:</i></b>
<p><b><i>Harleian MS 279, .xxvij. Soupes dorye</i> - "an &thorn;an take
Paynemayn, an kytte it an toste it, an wete it in wyne, an ley it on a
dysshe..."</b>
<p><b><i>Harleian MS 279, .xxviij. Soupes Jamberlayne</i> - "an &thorn;en
take Paynemaynne an kyt it in maner of brewes, an toste it, an wete it
in &thorn;e same lycowre, an ley it on a dysshe..."</b>
<p><b><i>Harleian MS 4016, Soppes Dorre</i> - "And then take a paynmain,
And kut him and tost him, And wete him in wyne, And ley hem in a dissh..."</b>
<p><b><i>Harleian MS 4016, Soppes pour Chamberleyne</i> - "And then take
paynmain, And kutte hit in a maner of Browes, And tost hit, And ley hit
in a dissh..."</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6666">(3.3)</font><i> sumdele</i> - somewhat. See
Austin, p. 147.</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF6666">(3.4)</font><i> coche</i> - couch; lay. See
definition of <i>Cowche</i> in Austin, p. 126.</b>
<p><b>Hodgett <i>(Stere Htt Well),</i> calling this recipe <i>Capons in
Sauce</i>, has seemingly misread the third word in the title of the MS
receipt as <i>Sorce </i>or<i> Sowce</i>; it is actually <i>dorre</i>.</b>
<p><b>Similar recipes for toasted bread in almond milk are found in Harleian
MS. 279, <i>.xxvij. Soupes dorye</i> (Austin, p. 11) and Harleian 4016,
<i>Soppes
Dorre</i> (Austin, p. 90). Since no capons appear in this recipe (see note,
below) and nearly identical recipes for this type of dish are called <i>dorre</i>
in other 15th century manuscripts, it can be safely deduced that <i>Capons
in dorre</i> is actually another version of the two meatless <i>Soppes
Dorre</i> recipes of the Harleian manuscripts:</b>
<blockquote><b>.xxvij. Soupes dorye - Take gode almaunde mylke y-draw wyth
wyn, an let hem boyle to-gederys, an caste &thorn;er-to Safroun an Salt;
an &thorn;an take Paynemayn, an kytte it an toste it, an wete it in wyne,
an ley it on a dysshe, an caste &thorn;e syrip &thorn;er-on. And &thorn;an
make a dragge of powder Gyngere, Sugre, canel, Clowes, Maces, an caste
&thorn;er-on When it is y-dressid, an serue &thorn;anne forth for a potage
gode. (Austin, 11)</b>
<p><b>Soppes Dorre. &para; Take rawe Almondes, And grynde hem in A morter,
And temper hem with wyn and drawe hem thorgh a streynour; And lete hem
boyle, And cast there-to Saffron, Sugur, and salt; And then take a paynmain,
And kut him and tost him, And wete him in wyne, And ley hem in a dissh,
and caste the siryppe thereon, and make a dregge of pouder ginger, sugur,
Canell, Clowes, and maces, And cast thereon; And whan hit is I-Dressed,
serue it forth fore a good potage. (Austin, 90)</b></blockquote>
<b>Despite the receipt's name, <i>Capons in dorre</i>, there is actually
no mention of capon in the directions. This is conceivably a scribal error
of two different possibilities. The more probable explanation is that
<i>Capons</i>
was accidentally re-copied from the title of the previous recipe, <i>Capons
stewed</i>; <i>Soppes</i> or <i>Sops</i> may have been the intended word
the scribe missed (see note on similar <i>dorre</i> recipes, above) and
this dish is merely a simple meatless <i>pottage</i> of sliced or diced
toast (brews) in almond milk, just like the <i>Soppes Dorre</i> recipes
found in the Harleian MS.</b>
<p><b>A less certain occurrence is that the instructions for including
the capon were mistakenly left out; in this case, the cooked capons would
have been placed on top of the toast in the dishes, and then covered with
the <i>dorre</i>. A recipe from Harleian MS 279, <i>.Cxliiij. Schyconys
with &thorn;e bruesse</i> (Austin, p. 32), is done in such a manner, with
chicken served on bread that has been made into thin <i>brewes</i>. However,
leaving out any mention of a necessary ingredient seems less probable than
the more likely explanation that the scribe's mistake here is in the receipt's
title and not in the directions.</b>
<p><b>Hodgett makes no clarification of this discrepancy between title
and recipe in <i>Stere Htt Well</i>.</b>
