Some say whan they be taken that they wepe. The Delphin hath none eares
for to here / nor no nose for to smelle / yet it smelleth very well

sharpe. And it slepeth vpon the water very hartely, that thei be hard

that yf it fortuned one of the yonges to dye, than these olde ones wyll
burye them depe in the gorwind of the see / because othere fisshes

      <p><b>The Dolphin is a monster of the sea; it has no voice, but
sings like
a man, and just before a storm it plays upon the water. Some say that
when
they are captured they weep. The Dolphin has no ears to hear with, nor
nose to smell with, yet it can smell very well and sharply. And it
sleeps
upon the water very heartily, so that it can be far from hard rocks.
They
live 140 years, and they gladly listen to the playing of musical
instruments,
such as lutes, harps, tabors, and pipes. They love their young very
well,
and breast-feed them for a long time. They have many young, and among
them
there are always 2 old ones, so that if it happened that one of the
young
were to die, then these old ones will bury them deep in the ground of
the
sea so that other fish will not eat the dead dolphin, so well they love
their young. There was once a king that had captured a dolphin which he
caused to be bound fast with chains at a haven where ships come in at,
but there was always the most pitiful weeping and lamenting that the
king,
in pity, let him go again.</b>
