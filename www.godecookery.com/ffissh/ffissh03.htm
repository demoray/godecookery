      <p><b>Cancer the crayfish is a fish of the sea that is enclosed
in a hard
shell, with many feet and claws, and it always walks backwards. The
male
has two pins on his belly, and the female has none. When they mate, the
male climbs on the female's back, and she turns her side towards him,
and
so they fulfill their duties. In May they change their coats (shed
their
outer shell), &amp; they hide for five months during winter. When the
crayfish
has had milk to drink, it may live a long time without water. When he
is
old, it has 2 stones with red spots in his head that have great virtue,
for if these stones are placed in a drink they take the pain away from
anything that hurts. The crayfish eats oysters, and gets them by a
certain
method. When the oyster shell opens, the crayfish throws little stones
into it, and so gets the fish, for the shell stays open. Crayfish ashes
are good for whitening teeth, and it keeps the moths out of clothes. It
removes biles and heals mange. Fresh-water crayfish is very good to
eat,
but it is a heavy food to digest.</b>

drowns
many ships. But when the mariners spy where he is, they gather around
him
in many ships with various musical instruments, &amp; they play with
great
harmony. And the fish is very glad of this harmony &amp; comes floating
above the water to be near the melody. Then they have among them an
instrument
of iron (a harpoon), which they fasten into the Cetus' hard skin, and
the
weight of the harpoon sinks down into the fat &amp; grease. With that,
the musical instruments suddenly become still and the ships depart from
there, and soon the Cetus sinks to the ground. When he feels the salt
water
smarting in his wound, he turns his belly upward and rubs the wound
against
the ground, and the more he rubs the deeper the harpoon enters, &amp;
he
rubs so long that he slays himself. And when he is dead, he comes up
again
quickly as he did before and shows that he is dead. Then the ships
gather
together again, and take the Cetus and lead it to land, where they make
a profit from it.</b>
