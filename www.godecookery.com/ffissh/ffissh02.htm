      <p><b>The Balena is a great beast of the sea which blows much
water from
itself, as if it were a cloud. Ships are in great danger of him
sometimes.
They are seen mostly towards winter, for in the summer thay are hidden
in sweet broad places of the water, where they take their young. When
the
Balena suffers great pain he floats above the water like someone
needing
help. The Balena's mouth is in his face, and therefore it moves much
water.
The female Balena gives birth to her young like other beasts on earth,
&amp; it sleeps. In temptuous weather she hides her young in her mouth,
and when the bad weather is past she puts them out again. They live for
10 years.</b></p>
