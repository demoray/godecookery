fish, and she sings a type of sweet song, and so decieves many a good
mariner,

and
takes them out of their ship and tears them asunder. They hold their
young

large,
hanging from their breasts. But the wise mariners cover their ears when
they see her, for when she plays on the water, all are afraid. Then
