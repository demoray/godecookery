boats
which take these mussels. Solinus says that this mussel has an
uppermost
shell so wide that it may cover a house and many people could hide
under
it. And it goes out of the water onto the land and there lays a hundred
eggs as large as goose eggs, and covers them with earth, &amp; often at
night it goes to the eggs and covers them with her breast, and then
