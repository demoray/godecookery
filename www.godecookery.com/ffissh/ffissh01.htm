Herring is best from the beginning of August to December, and when it
is
fresh is very delicious to eat. It is a very special food to man when
it
has been salted. Herring cannot live without water, for as soon as they
feel the air they die. They are taken together in great heaps, for
wherever
they can see light they will be, and so are taken with nets, which come
from the divine Providence of almighty God.</b>

the
most part he has his back high above the water in such a manner that
some
shipmen that see him think that it is a little island, &amp; when they
come to it they cast their anchors upon him, &amp; go out of their
ships
&amp; make a fire upon him to cook their food. And as soon as he feels
the heat of the fire then he swims from that place, &amp; drowns them,
&amp; draws the ship to the ground. And his normal behavior is when,
when
he has hunger, to open his mouth wide open, &amp; out of it flows a
sweet
air which attracts fish, and then he eats them.</b>

his head into his belly. When he then becomes hungry, he eats a part of
