Medieval feasts and dinners were remarkably similar to our
own modern
manner of eating; today's meals generally start out light, such as with
a soup or salad, then move on to the heavier items of meats and
vegetables,
and end with something sweet - and the more formal or special the
occasion,
the more likely the dessert will be something extravagant or showy.
Medieval
meals, too, followed such a pattern, but the reasons for the foods that
were eaten, how they were prepared, and when they were eaten followed a
train of thought much different than ours of today.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In the Western world of the
21st c., the ideas of proper
nutrition
and the analyzing of food properties and qualities is a complex and
efficient
science that has changed the world in many positive ways. From
ingredient
lists on packages to the mass instruction of such concepts as the "food
pyramid," modern society has a knowledge of food and its true
nutritional
value that far exceeds anything our medieval ancestors could have
imagined.
Still, medieval culture was well aware of the truth in the thought that
we truly are what we eat, and had its own complex science that
prescribed
what should be eaten, and when. And the medieval version of the
contemporary
"food pyramid" was the Four Humour system.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <center>
      <p><img src="../images/scroll.gif"
 style="height: 20px; width: 385px;" title="" alt="" hspace="10"></p>
      </center>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In a nutshell, the Four
Humour system was a philosophy,
along with
astrology, followed by most physicians, medics, and intellectuals of
the
Middle Ages that believed, like astrology, that all things - man,
animals,
the four seasons, planets, etc. - existed under the effects of certain
influences and inner manifestations; in this case, four specific
properties
called the Four Humours. These four qualities, or conditions, were <i>Melancholy</i>,
      <i>Choler</i>, <i>Phlegm</i>,
&amp; <i>Blood </i>(with many other names and versions also in
existence). <i>Melancholy</i>
had the properties of cold and dry, and was associeted with the god
Saturn. <i>Choler</i>
was hot and dry and was linked to Mars, the god of war. <i>Phlegm</i>
was
governed by&nbsp;<img src="feastp02.jpg" align="right" border="1"
 height="405" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="288">the
Moon Goddess and was cold and moist. <i>Blood</i> was a hot and moist
condition,
ruled by Venus. Men &amp; women were supposedly influenced by the
bodily
presence of these Humours, with the excess of any one of them affecting
personality, feelings, and behavior. A person with increased <i>Melancholy
      </i>was
said to "loveth and desyre dethe" and to be prone to delusions and
depression,
but to also be sensitive and perhaps dignified. <i>Choler </i>made
one
unkindly and "wrathful, hardy," and "unstable." Those affected by an
excess
of <i>Choler</i> were recommended to eat leeks, onions, or garlic only
at their own peril. An excessive amount of <i>Phlegm </i>induced
slothfulness,
and its subjects were "fatte, greate and shorte and croked in
extremyties,"
while <i>Blood</i> was a sign of heat, youth, and passion, and other
healthier
aspects. Too much <i>Blood </i>in an older man, however, could cause
a
heart attack.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <center>
      <p><b><i><font size="-1">The Humours portrayed as Four Men, from
a manuscript
in the British Museum; clockwise from upper-left: Melancholy, Blood,
Phlegm,
&amp; Choler .</font></i></b></p>
      </center>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>As these four influences
played their part with man, they
did so
with food as well. Medieval cooks were advised by physicians to prepare
foods that were properly balanced with these four Humours in mind, the
same as today's cooks are trained to present meals that are balanced in
nutrition. For example, fish, which are cold and moist, should be
served
with spices or sauces that are hot and dry, to counteract against an
excess
of <i>Phlegm</i>. Plump and moist young male chickens were castrated
into
capons to prevent them from maturing sexually, a process which would
increase <i>Blood</i>
and therefore make their meat dry. Foods which were naturally dry were
boiled, never roasted, while moist foods were baked to dry them out.
(Consider
how dry a plainly roasted carrot is, and how horrible a boiled pie
would
be!) Eating foods that were properly in balance kept the eater in
balance
as well, and menus were arranged with the familar concept of light
foods
first, heavier foods later, all properly spiced and prepared in such a
manner as to counteract whatever excess of humour was present.</b></div>

      <p><b><a
 href="http://www.adh.bton.ac.uk/schoolofdesign/MA.COURSE/LPR09.html">Here
is another historical depiction of the Four Humours, from The
Shepherd's
Calendar, published by Nicholas Le Rouge, Troyes, c1495.</a></b> </p>
      <p><img src="../images/scroll.gif"
 style="height: 20px; width: 385px;" title="" alt=""></p>
      </center>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dinners &amp; feasts usually
started with foods that were
considered
easily digestible, such as light meats, warm &amp; moist foods such as
soups and broths, moist fruits (especially peaches), and greens such as
lettuce, cabbage, and "herbs." Spices were thought to warm the stomach,
and were therefore an excellent stomach opener. Cheese was eaten both
before
and during the meal, as an aid to digestion and to help a "weak
stomach."
Foods that were more difficult to digest, such as beef &amp; fatty pork
and heavy fruits, like pears &amp; chestnuts, were consumed later in
the
meal. In large feasts, very rich and exotic foods were served in
smaller
portions only to highly distinguished guests after the more filling and
common dishes had been served to the entire hall. This practice would
continue
as the feast progressed, ending with the finest of delicacies being
served
to just the table of the king or nobleman in charge of the affair.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>When meat was eaten, it was
normally followed with cheese,
which
physicians recommended for proper digestion. When fish was served, it
was
followed with nuts, for essentially the same reason. Wines and ales of
all sorts were consumed during the entire meal. Sweets, like today,
were
saved for last, and spices were again used here as a digestive aid to
end
the meal. Wine, as a custom, was drunk just before retiring, and so the
evening would usually end with a snack of sweet fruits &amp; cakes,
&amp;
spiced wines.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Dinners were arranged in
courses, each course containing
several
items, with several courses in each dinner. A feast may contain many
courses
with just a few dishes in each, or just a few courses with many dishes
included. After the final course came the concluding presentation of
wine
and sweets. At royal feasts, the courses were broken up with a
mini-course
called an <i>entremet</i>, featuring lavish presentations and
spectacles,
and fantastic and fanciful foods called <i>solteties</i>. These exotic
creations were crafted mainly from sugar and made to represent saints,
warriors, heroes, scenes from mythology, etc., but also were such
dishes
as the <a href="../cocken/cocken.htm">Cockentrice</a> and the <a
 href="../helmeted/helmeted.htm">Coqz
Heaumez</a>. Food-in-disguise was also a popular <i>soltetie</i>, and
a
cake could appear as a realistic looking fish and a meatloaf could be
crafted
to resemble a fancily painted pitcher. Beautiful and awe-inspiring, a
well-presented <i>soltetie</i>
was a masterpice of imagination and skill on the cook's part.
Spectacles
often included music, singing, and play-acting. The French cookbook <i>Le
Viandier de Taillevent</i> describes a spectacle which featured a tower
manned by a boy dressed as the mythological wild man of the woods, who
would throw rocks at a group of attacking soldiers below.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <center>
      <p><img src="feastp03.gif" height="207" width="344"></p>
      </center>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>A modern medieval feast,
whether done for friends and
family as an
amusement, or presented by schools and historical societies for the
public,
should follow the traditional standards of the Middle Ages. Begin
dinner
with soup or broth, bread, &amp; cheese. Follow with green vegetables,
a meat dish of lean pork or chicken, or perhaps fish, accompanied with
sauces, then move on to the heavier and fancier items, in smaller
portions.
End with sweets and spiced desserts. Serve wine and ale throughout the
entire meal, or if the event is non-alcoholic, use apple cider, grape
juice,
lemonade, water, etc. Just don't let your guests go thirsty! Divide the
various dishes among two or three courses, serving each course in its
entirety
and leaving time for talk, music, &amp; entertainment for guests
between
courses. For larger events, separate the two main courses with an
amusing
and entertaining presentation, such as a performance of some sort or an
unusual or flashy food item - a roast pig always has a welcome audience
at a time like this, or try a fancy food-in-disguise <i>soltetie</i>.
A
good medieval feast should last at least several hours, and your guests
should leave not only full of delicious food, but emotionally satisfied
and intellectually entertained. Give them one final drink and a sweet
morsel
to send them on their way home, but first make sure they offer a toast
to the evening, the friends present, and the magnificent cook who made
it all possible!</b></div>
