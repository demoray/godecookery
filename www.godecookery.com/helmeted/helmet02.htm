<p><b>In the Middle Ages, one of the more fanciful culinary creations was
the famed Cockentrice, made by stitching together a suckling pig and a
capon, this creating a "new" animal. (Please visit <a href="../cocken/cocken.htm">The
Cockentrice - A Ryal Mete</a> for further information.) Serving almost
as a sort of companion to the Cockentrice is the Coqz Heaumez, or Helmeted
Cock, another fantastic combination of pig and fowl, which appears in the
Medieval French Cookbook of Guillaume Tirel, known today as <i>Le Viandier
de Taillevent</i>:</b>
<p><b><i>196. Coqz Heaumez. Mettez cochons rostir, et poulalaille comme
coqz et vielles poulles, et quant le cochon sera rosty d'une part et la
poulaille d'autre convient farsir la poullaille - sans escorcher, qui veult;
et la convient farsir de paste batue aux oeuf; et quant ell'est doree la
convient mettre a chevauchons sur le cochon, et fault ung heaume de papier
colle et une lance fichie a la poittrine de la dicte poullaille, et les
fault couvrir de fueil d'or ou d'argent pour les seigneurs, ou de feul
d'estain blanc, vermeil ou vert.</i></b>
<p><b><i>Le Viandier de Taillevent</i> is available today in an edition
by Terence Scully, who translated each of the cookbook's Medieval French
recipes into contemporary English, including Coqz Heaumez:</b>
<p><b>196. Coqz heaumez: Helmeted Cocks. Roast piglets and such poultry
as cocks and old hens; when both the piglet and the poultry are roasted,
the poultry should be stuffed - without skinning it, if you wish; it should
be (glazed) with an egg batter. And when it is glazed it should be seated
astride the piglet; and it needs a helmet of glued paper and a lance couched
at the breast of the bird, and these should be covered with gold-or-silver-leaf
for lords, or with white, red or green tin-leaf.</b>
<p><b>Guillaume's recipe, as it appears in the four surviving original
versions of <i>Le Viandier</i>, is the only known receipt for Coqz Heaumez,
while instructions for Cockentrice are extant in many period manuscripts;
Cockentrice, as a whole, were therefore more well known &amp; common at
feasts &amp; banquets in the Middle Ages than the Helmeted Cock. Still,
Guillaume's creation is a wonderful example of the kind of novelties invented
by Medieval cooks, and the combination of pig as noble steed &amp; chicken
as knight-errant has the same amusing connotations now as it did then.</b>
<p><b>Coqz Heaumez is described by Terence Scully as being an "entremets;"
that is, a dish that was meant to be served between the main courses. Imagine,
then, the delight of the Medieval feaster who has just finished a scrumptious
course of delicacies and tender morsels, and is offered this magnificent
presentation dressed in colors that honored the lords present - not as
another course, but simply as a snack between meals!</b>
