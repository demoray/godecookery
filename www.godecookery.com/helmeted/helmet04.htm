<p><b>This Helmeted Cock was being prepared for a Christmas/12th Night
celebration hosted by <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/scafeast/scafeast.htm">The
Society for Creative Anachronism</a> on January 10th, 1998, in Morgantown,
WV. (Please visit <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/scafeast/12thnite.htm">AEthelmearc
12th Night 1998</a> for more information.) On the morning of the feast,
I arrived at the site of the event at about 6 a.m. Both the pig and the
chicken had been thawed and brought to the site the day before. As it had
a longer cooking time, the pig was prepared first. A large batch of ordinary
bread stuffing (croutons, broth, &amp; spices), mixed with chopped cooked
pork liver and the chopped cooked gizzards from the pig &amp; chicken,
was made. The pig was stuffed with this, and expertly sewn shut with a
large needle and string by Sue Wensel. It was then arranged on a large
baking sheet in a sitting position and placed in a 400&deg; F degree oven
to cook for about 4 hours.</b>

<p><b>The chicken was filled with same stuffing mixture and also placed
on a large baking sheet.&nbsp;<img SRC="coqz03.jpg" HSPACE=10 BORDER=3 height=356 width=237 align=LEFT>The
mouth of the bird was pried open with a small piece of bamboo skewer and
left open, and the chicken itself was arranged in a sitting position by
use of aluminum foil and bamboo skewers (see illustration on left); since
our cock was to be riding the pig, the position of the bird while roasting
was important. Aluminum foil was placed over the wings and the head, to
prevent those more delicate sections from over-cooking, and then two hours
into the roasting of the pig, the prepared chicken was placed in a 375&deg;
F degree oven and allowed to cook until just done, but not tender, which
took about two hours. Overcooking the bird would have been a disaster and
so it was carefully watched and removed from the oven as soon as it was
fully cooked but still quite firm. If cooked too tender, the chicken would
have fallen apart. After both had cooled, they were ready for the mounting!</b>

<p><b>To guarantee that the cock would actually ride his steed, and not
slide with a greasy "thud" to the floor, Darell McCormick and his father
had made a support device from two sharpened dowel rods extending from
a small wooden base. The pig was impaled on the two rods, which came up
through the middle of its back, and then the chicken was placed on top,
the two rods holding the bird quite securely. The base and the rods were
completely invisible and held the Coqz Heaumez together without any effort.
The rods had been measured earlier so they were the right length to just
come up into the thick breast area, providing strong support. Now they
were ready for dressing.</b>

<p><b>Although the original recipe only calls for the chicken carrying
a small lance &amp; wearing a paper helmet, the crew of creative cooks
that worked with me that day came prepared to treat our knight in the best
fashion possible. Darell McCormick made a cone-shaped helmet from construction
paper, then covered it in silver fabric so it looked very much like real
metal. Scott Hofer came up with a small wooden shield, covered in a heraldic
coat-of-arms, which fastened around the chicken's left wing. Stephen Vandevander
made a parti-colored lance of wood and foil, and Glenda Cockrum dressed
the bird in a miniature red tabard and made a saddle of black cloth for
the pig. Ty Clifford assisted all. The pig was provided with a small bridle
of leather and foil. When complete, the Coqz Heaumez was a stunning sight.
Guillaume would have been proud.</b>
