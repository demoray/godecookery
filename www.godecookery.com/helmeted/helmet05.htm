<p><b>For those readers unfamiliar with <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/scafeast/scafeast.htm">The
Society for Creative Anachronism</a>, this organization, dedicated to recreating
the culture of the Middle Ages &amp; Renaissance, divides its chapters
into areas called Kingdoms. Each Kingdom is "ruled" by a King who is chosen
by right of arms during combat competitions (called "tourneys"). In the
Kingdom of AEthelmearc, where this feast was being held, the King at the
time was a fine gentleman who called himself Yngvar the Dismal. In keeping
with the instructions in the original recipe to decorate the Coqz Heaumez
in honor of the lords present, our Helmeted Cock wore the colors of AEthelmearc
&amp; carried a shield that bore its coat-of-arms. In addition, to add
to the merriment and to compliment King Yngvar, the Coqz Heaumez was dubbed
"Syr Wyngvar" (at the witty suggestion of Sue Wensel) and wore the King's
coat-of-arms on his red tabard. As the Coqz Heaumez was brought into the
hall, a herald cried out "Announcing the entrance of Syr Wyngvar!" His
Grace seemed quite pleased with this fowl facsimile.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>Syr Wyngvar on Display</font></b></center>

<p><b>Syr Wyngvar was placed on display for two hours, then with a great
cry to everyone present, I announced that those who wished to eat him,
should, as I darn well couldn't take the thing home with me! (It would
have scared my cat.) Within minutes the Coqz Heaumez was consumed, and
all that was left was skin &amp; bones. But, that was not the final end
of Syr Wyngvar and his noble steed Piggiekins; the heads of both creatures
were placed on sticks by two happy fools, who paraded them about the hall,
much to the amusement of everyone present. A fitting end for a Helmeted
Cock!</b>
