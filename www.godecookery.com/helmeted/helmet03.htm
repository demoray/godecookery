<p><b>When I began making the initial plans for preparing a Coqz Heaumez,
one thing was immediately apparent: a whole chicken, with the head included,
was needed. Anything else simply would not do Procuring a pig was no problem,
as I had established a relationship with an excellent butcher when making
my first Cockentrice, but the chicken was another matter! Finding one in
my local supermarket or grocers was, of course, out of the question. No
butcher I talked to could supply a whole chicken, slaughtered &amp; dressed.
The best recommendation I received was to attend a farmer's auction, purchase
a live chicken, and do the butchering myself. Not quite ready to be this
authentic, I began to give up the idea of ever being able to prepare this
recipe properly, when, by chance, I heard that whole chickens were occasionally
used in certain Jewish dishes and that I might be able to obtain one through
a supplier of Kosher foods. Soon, a little more digging provided the answer
I was looking for in the discovery of a Kosher poultry butcher, located
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I contacted the establishment, and was told
that, yes, they did slaughter poultry and I could purchase one intact directly
from them.</b>
<p><b>Obtaining the chicken was one of the most unique culinary experiences
of my life, second only to my tour of a slaughterhouse while attending
Culinary school! The butcher who could provide me with the rarity of a
chicken with the head still attached was Greenburg's Kosher Poultry, located
on Murray Ave. in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Slaughtering was on Sundays,
so I was told to be there about noon. Inside, the establishment itself
didn't seem out of the ordinary, except for the fact that in the rear of
the building, clearly visible through several open doorways and windows,
chickens were methodically being killed, plucked, &amp; gutted. Squawks
and screeches filled the air, which had the occasional feather wafting
through it. I presented myself to Mr. Greenburg, a polite and courteous
gentleman who only seemed slightly curious about my purchase, and then
waited while he prepared my order.</b>
<p><b>As I waited, I read a displayed newspaper article on Greenburg's
and was surprised to learn that the chickens being slaughtered were in
fact raised in the very same building, in a poultry farm located in the
basement! According to the article, about 200 chickens were slaughtered
each week, in the prescribed Jewish manner for Kosher preparation. First,
a Rabbi blessed the chicken, then kissed a razor sharp blade and quickly
slit the chicken's throat so it would feel as little pain as possible.
The now dead chicken was placed in a machine which quickly removed all
the feathers, and then in several expert moves was instantly gutted by
one of Mr. Greenburg's assistants. I once again peeked into the back room,
and saw that exact procedure laid out before me. Someone who was obviously
a Rabbi was moving about the room, and whenever he would disappear from
my view, I would hear the sound of a chicken loudly squawking. Then, suddenly,
dead silence, and the Rabbi would reappear, holding a dead chicken which
was then placed in the feather-removal apparatus. While that chicken was
being prepared, the Rabbi would once again disappear from my view and the
procedure would start over.</b>
<p><b>Soon, I had my bird. Handed to me while still warm, wrapped in butcher's
paper, it had been alive only minutes before. This was one fresh chicken!
It was a beautiful fowl, large and plump, weighing nearly 10 lb., with
the head feathers and cockscomb still attached. I knew it would make a
lovely rider for any suckling pig!</b>

<p><b>The 22 lb. pig was obtained from my usual butcher, McConnell's Meat
Market of Richmond, Ohio, which also both raises and slaughters its produce.
McConnell's, however, is a far cry from the streets of Pittsburgh, being
located in the lovely countryside of south-western Ohio. Both animals were
just the right size for each other, and if they weren't being specifically
used as a Helmeted Cock would've made an excellent Cockentrice. They were
carefully wrapped and frozen in preparation for the feast where they would
make their appearance.</b>
