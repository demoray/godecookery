One of the more fanciful and imaginative dishes of the
Middle Ages
was the cockentrice, made by combining a pig and a capon into one
creature,
thus creating a "new" animal that would not only feed hungry folk but
amuse
and amaze them as well. <i>"Cockentrice"</i> is actually just one
among
many spellings of the name of this dish; originally the beast was also
known as a <i>cokagrys</i> or <i>cotagres</i>, from <i>"cock"</i> (a
capon)
and <i>"grys"</i> (a pig); a <i>"gryse"</i> was a suckling pig. Other
period
spellings include <i>koketris</i>, <i>cocagres</i>, <i>cokyntryche</i>,
c<i>ockyntryce</i>, and <i>cokantrice</i>. Cockentrice were common
entries
at great dinners, and a <i>cokyntryche</i> is listed among the many
feast
items at a festival given by John Stafford, Bishop of Bath &amp; Wells,
on September 16, 1425. Incidentally, the cockentrice is NOT the
infamous <i>Cockatrice</i>,
that fabulous mythical serpent that had the power to kill with a
glance.
Our edible cockentrice is a much safer and delicious creature.</b></div>
      <p> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recipes for the cockentrice
can be found in three common
primary
sources: the <i>Harleian Manuscript no. 279</i> &amp; the <i>Douce
Manuscript
no. 55</i>, as found in <i>Two 15th c. Cookery-Books</i> by Thomas
Austin
(1888) and <i>Forme of Cury</i>, as found in <i>Curye on Inglysch</i>
by
Constance Hieatt &amp; Sharon Butler (1985). <i>Two 15th c.
Cookery-Books</i>
contains two recipes for cockentrice, while <i>Forme of Cury</i> has
just
one. The recipes from the <i>Harleian</i> &amp; <i>Douce Manuscripts</i>
are nearly identical to each other: both describe creating the animal
in
the same fashion, by cutting the capon &amp; pig in half then sewing
the
two together; both have a stuffing made of bread, eggs, sheep suet, and
spices; both are gilded with egg yolks, saffron, ginger, &amp; parsley
juice. <i>Forme of Cury's</i> recipe is slightly different. In this
version
the animal is constructed in the same manner, but the stuffing is made
of pork liver, eggs, currants, pine nuts, and spices, and the
cockentrice
is gilded with silver and gold foil. For the convenience of this
documentation,
I have labeled the recipes from <i>Two 15th c. Cookery-Books</i> as
Recipe
1 &amp; Recipe 2. The receipt found in <i>Forme of Cury</i> is
hereafter
referred to as Recipe 3. The translations that follow the period
recipes
are my own, and are based on the glossaries found in <i>Two 15th c.
Cookery-Books</i>
and <i>Curye on Inglysch.</i></b></div>
