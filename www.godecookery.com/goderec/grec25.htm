<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>2 lbs. squash peeled and in chunks</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 onions, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 cups <a href="grec15.htm">Gode Broth</a> (made without bread crumbs)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cup pork, boiled then minced or ground (see note on vegetarian substitution)</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 egg yolks, beaten</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp. salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 tbs. of sugar and 1 tbs. each of cinnamon &amp; ginger, mixed together</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Boil to a boil the broth, squash, and onions. Reduce heat and cook until
the squash just becomes tender. (Don't overcook or you'll wind up with
mush.) Stir in the pork, egg yolks, saffron, and salt. Stir; allow to cook
for a few minutes, then remove from heat. Serve with the sugar &amp; spice
mixture as a garnish or in small serving bowls with spoons off to the side,
to allow guests to season as they may.</b>
<p><b>Recipes for vegetables dishes in period manuscripts are vastly outnumbered
by those for meat, fish, &amp; poultry. Since many vegetables were prepared
simply, it was often not considered necessary to waste precious parchment
on their cooking instructions. Also, feasts, in general, served more meat
and in more varieties than the 20th c. diner is used to. Therefore, what
vegetable recipes that do survive are of particular value to those recreating
Medieval food. For the modern cook seeking vegetable dishes for a feast,
<i>Gourdes
in Potage</i> may be a disappointment because of the inclusion of pork;
however, I've found that substituting the pork with an equal amount of
ground walnuts works quite well, and by using non-meat or meat-flavored
broth, allows me to present an entirely vegetarian dish for those at feasts
who do not prefer meat. Add the walnuts at the beginning with the squash
&amp; onions so they'll be tender and not crunchy.</b>
<p><b>The squash can be of any variety available to you - I've even used
pumpkin, which works very well for Autumn or Harvest feasts when pumpkin
is plentiful &amp; cheap.</b>
<p><b>The <i>powdour douce </i>of the original recipe was a mild mixture
of ground spices, usually sugar with cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves,
etc., but never pepper.</b>
