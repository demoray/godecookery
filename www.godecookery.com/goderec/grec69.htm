<p><b><font size=-1>PERIOD:</font> France, 14th century | <font size=-1>SOURCE:</font>

<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> A meat pie decorated with crenelated
pastry and miniature banners</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=-1>ORIGINAL RECEIPT:</font></b>
<p><b>197. Tourtes parmeriennes: Parmesan Pies. Take mutton, veal or pork
and chop it up sufficiently small; then boil poultry and quarter it --
and the other meat must be cooked before being chopped up: then get fine
powder and sprinkle it on the meat very sensibly, and fry your meat in
bacon grease. Then get large open pastry shells -- which should have higher
sides than usual and should be the size of small plates -- and shape them
with crenellations; they should be of a strong dough in order to hold the
meat. If you wish, you can mix pine nut paste and currants among the meat,
with granulated sugar on top; into each pastry put three or four chicken
quarters in which to plant the banners of France and of the lords who will
be present, and glaze them with moistened saffron to give them a better
appearance. For anyone who does not want to go to such expense for poultry,
all he has to do is make flat pieces of pork or of mutton, either roasted
or boiled. When the pies are filled with their meat, the meat on top should
be glazed with a little beaten egg, both yolks and whites, so that this
meat will hold together solidly enough to set the banners in it. And you
should have gold-leaf or tin-leaf to glaze the pies before setting the
banners in them.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 &frac12; lbs. cooked veal, mutton, or pork, diced</b></li>

<li>
<b>&frac12; - 1 tsp. each of salt, pepper, cloves, cardamom, ginger, cubeb,
etc. - use to taste.</b></li>

<li>
<b>small amount bacon grease or cooking oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>one 9" (or larger) deep-dish pie shell</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 batch <a href="../begrec/begrec05.htm">Basic Pastry</a></b></li>

<li>
<b>1 beaten egg white</b></li>

<li>
<b>OPTIONAL: 1 cup ground pine nuts (or substitute ground walnuts or almonds)</b></li>

<li>
<b>OPTIONAL: 1 cup currants</b></li>

<li>
<b>OPTIONAL: 1 Tbs. sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 chicken quarters (thigh and leg sections attached), boiled until just
done</b></li>

<li>
<b>few threads saffron moistened in a little water (or few drops yellow
food coloring mixed with 1 beaten egg yolk)</b></li>

<li>
<b>OPTIONAL: 3 -4 flat pieces of roasted or boiled mutton or pork (boneless)</b></li>

<li>
<b>OPTIONAL: 1 beaten egg</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 beaten egg yolks colored with a few drops of yellow food coloring</b></li>

<li>
<b>about &frac12; dozen wooden skewers (kabob-style)</b></li>

<li>
<b>kite string or butcher's thread</b></li>

<li>
<b>glue</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 small banners or flags (see NOTE below)</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Heat a small amount of bacon grease or oil in the bottom of a large
frying pan; saut&eacute; the meat and the spices in this until lightly
browned; remove from oil. The meat should be moist; if too dry, add some
wine or broth.</b>
<p><b>OPTIONAL VERSION: Make a paste out of the ground pine nuts and a
little water; mix well together the meat, paste, and currants.</b>
<p><b>Place meat filling in the pie shell; if using the pine nut/currant
version, sprinkle the 1 Tbs. sugar on top. Arrange the whole chicken quarters
on top of the filling, and brush the chicken with the saffron water or
the colored yolk.</b>
<p><b>OPTIONAL VERSION: if not using chicken, cover the top of the filling
with flat pieces of cooked pork or mutton. Brush the entire top with the
beaten egg.</b>
<p><b>Roll out the Basic Pastry to a piece of dough &frac14; to &frac12;
inch thick; with a knife cut out small rectangular blocks of dough approx.
1 &frac12; inches long and &frac12; inch tall. These are the "crenellations."
(The idea is to make the rim of the pie shell resemble the top of a castle
wall with battlements.) Brush the beaten egg white on the pastry rim of
the pie; brush egg white on the bottom of the crenellations, and arrange
them evenly around the rim so that the final effect resembles the indented
parapets of castle battlements.</b>
<p><b>Place your finished pie in a 350&deg; F oven and bake for approx.
45 minutes, or until the pastry begins to turn a golden brown. Remove from
oven. Immediately brush the top of the entire pie with the yellow egg yolk
&amp; food coloring glaze. (This will substitute for using gold or tin
leaf.)</b>
<p><b>While the pie is baking, you will be making small flagpoles with
the skewers, string, &amp; glue to place on top of the pie. Cut 1 skewer
into 3 pieces, each being in length a little longer than the width of your
miniature flags. Attach the flags to these pieces by folding the top around
the skewer and securing with glue. Cut out 3 pieces of string with lengths
longer than the flag sections; glue each end of the string to the ends
of the flag section, then glue the middle of the string to the top of one
of the uncut skewers. This makes your flag - please see the illustration
below for a view of the finished results.</b>

<p><b><i><font size=-1>This is a scan of one of the flags shown in the
photograph below.</font></i></b></center>

<p><b>After the pie has been removed from the oven, plant one flagpole
in each chicken quarter or in the flat pieces of meat. (Sharpening the
bottom of the skewer will help.) Serve at once.</b>
<p><b>NOTE on the flags: when done at a Medieval event, these flags should
ideally be the coats-of-arms of some of the people attending the feast.
For other dinners, the flags should at least be personal and recognizable
(a school's flag or mascot, a team's colors, etc.); otherwise, use any
colorful design that feels appropriate, but try not to use any modern standards
if it can be helped.</b>

<p><b>Here is a photograph of <i>Tourtes parmeriennes</i> made for a dinner
in January 1998. Please keep in mind that these were just 6 of 37 pies
made for a 300-person feast! Because of the sheer numbers involved, only
1 chicken quarter and 1 flag were used per pie. A 3-banner pie is a much
more impressive sight, as you may see below.</b>
