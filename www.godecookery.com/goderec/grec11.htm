<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> Basic recipe for a medieval/Renaissance-style
meat pie</b><b></b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%"><b></b>
<p><b>Medieval meat pies usually consisted of beef, pork, venison, or fowl,
or a mixture of those meats. The meat was either broiled or boiled, then
either used in small bite-sized chunks, or else reduced to a paste by mashing
or "mortaring," and mixed with other ingredients. To make a basic medieval
meat pie, choose your meat - a nice roast or even a cheaper cut will do
nicely. Don't use pre-ground raw meat (such as hamburger) - it's not period,
and will completely change the taste of your product. Use about 1 &frac12;
lbs. for a pie that will feed 6-8 people. Broil or boil it until tender,
remove from the broth or drippings and let cool. Chop in bite-sized chunks,
mince very small, or chop small and pass through a food grinder or processor
to achieve a paste. Mix into the meat any of the following: egg yolks (for
liquid and binding), raisins, currants, nuts, cheese, dates, figs, a splash
of wine, seasonings (ginger, salt, pepper, etc.) - be creative and have
fun! Mix these ingredients either with the meat chunks or blend them in
with the meat paste and place in a pre-baked pie shell . The final mixture
should be a little too moist and just slightly runny - it'll stiffen up
when baked, and the extra moisture will keep the pie from going dry. Liquid
to use: egg yolks, wine, broth, etc. Medieval pies (sometimes called "bake
metis" in Medieval days) were often topped with either a pastry shell (often
called a "coffin") or "byrdys." (Medieval man had a reputation for eating
practically anything with wings! "Byrdys" could be any small bird, ranging
from swallows, sparrows, to game hens. For the 21st c. kitchen, small cooked
chicken pieces such as small thighs or the "drumstick" section of the wing
will do nicely.) After preparation, the pies can either be cooked at once
or frozen in the raw state to be thawed &amp; cooked later. When baking
time comes, keep them in the oven until the pastry is golden brown. Meat
pies can be served hot, at room temperature, or even chilled from the fridge.
This means that the busy feast cook can make the necessary pies in advance,
and freeze or hold refrigerated until the feastday. They can then be easily
cooked or re-heated, or simply served at room temperature. (Be careful,
of course, to not let the pies stand in the open too long. Food poisoning
is period but as welcome as the plague.) One of the best sources that I
know of for finding medieval pie recipes is Austin's <i>Two Fifteenth-Century
Cookery-Books </i>(consisting of 2 period manuscripts) which has an entire
section devoted to "Bake Metis."</b><b></b>
