<p><b><font size=+2>Pears</font></b>
<p><b><font size=-1>PERIOD:</font> France, 14th century | <font size=-1>SOURCE:</font>
Chiquart's "On Cookery" | <font size=-1>CLASS:</font> Authentic</b>
<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> A simple recipe of&nbsp; baked
pears</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b><font size=-1>ORIGINAL RECEIPT:</font></b>
<p><b>Again, pears cooked without coals or water: to instruct the person
who will be cooking them, he should get a good new earthenware pot, then
get the number of pears he will be wanting to cook and put them into that
pot; when they are in it, stop it up with clean little sticks of wood in
such a way that when the pot is upside down on the hot coals it does not
touch them at all; then turn it upside down on the hot coals and keep it
covered over with coals and leave it to cook for an hour or more. Then
uncover them and check whether they have cooked enough, and leave them
there until they are cooked enough. When they are cooked, put them out
into fine silver dishes; then they are borne to the sick person.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>MODERN RECIPE:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>pears, cored</b></li>

<li>
<b>cinnamon &amp; sugar to taste (optional)</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Place whole, cored fruit in a baking dish or pan and bake at 400&deg;
F until the fruit has completely turned a deep brown, about 1/2 hour to
45 minutes. Sprinkle with cinnamon &amp; sugar and serve.</b>
<p><b>This recipe is much less elaborate than it appears in the original,
and is simply pears baked in an oven, very much like our contemporary baked
apple but without the addition of sugar &amp; spices. Baked pears were
thought to have medicinal properties and were one of the foods considered
appropriate for the ill, hence the instruction to give them to the sick
person. Feasts often ended with baked apples &amp; pears, served with the
other spices &amp; confections of the dessert course. Keeping that in mind,
the modern recipe has been sweetened with a little cinnamon &amp; sugar.</b>
