<p><b>In the Middle Ages, animal milk was, of course, not refrigerated,
and fresh milk did not stay fresh for long. Most cooks simply did not use
much milk as the short shelf-life of the product made it a difficult ingredient
to depend upon. Many recipe collections of the time advise that cooks should
only rely on milk that comes directly from a cow, something not possible
at all times, and purchasing milk was a dubious practice, for streetsellers
of milk often sold wares that were either spoiled or diluted with water.
Milk's use had to be immediate, in cooking or by turning into cheese &amp;
butter. It was these difficulties that forced Medieval cooks to look upon
milk with great reluctance, and so having milk in the kitchen was usually
unheard of.</b>
<p><b>Rather than animal milk, Medieval cooks turned to something they
could depend upon, and that was the milky liquid produced by grinding almonds
or walnuts. This liquid, high in natural fats, could be prepared fresh
whenever needed in whatever quantities. It also could be made well ahead
of time and stored with no danger of degeneration. Because of its high
fat content, it, like animal milk, could be churned into butter, and because
it was <i>not</i> animal milk, it could be used and consumed during Church
designated meatless days.</b>
<p><b>Almond milk was used extensively in period; all existing cookbooks
call for it, and it must have been found in literally every Medieval kitchen.
It's the prime ingredient in many, many recipes, and the modern cook recreating
Medieval food will have to learn its production in order to prepare the
most common of dishes. Fortunately, it's easily made. I prefer the recipe
of Terence Scully, as printed in <i>Le Viandier de Taillevent</i>, p. 315:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 cup ground almonds</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 cups boiling water</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Combine almonds and water. Steep for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Sieve the mixture to remove coarse grains OR (preferably) blend mixture
in electric blender until grains are absorbed. Yield - 2 cups almond milk.</b>
