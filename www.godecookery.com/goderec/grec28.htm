<p><b><font size=-1>DESCRIPTION:</font> recipe for white bread</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 WIDTH="80%">
<p><b>Bread is literally the staple of life. Mankind has been baking bread
for thousands of years in an innumerable amount of ways with a wide assortment
of ingredients. There is bread made with barley, oats, wheat, rye, beer,
eggs, saffron, tomatoes, potatoes, parsley, nuts, fruit, etc. If it can
be eaten, it can be made or incorporated into bread somehow. Bread can
also assume a variety of shapes and styles. It can be made into rolls,
loaves, buns; it can be stiff and dry like a good French Bread, or soft
&amp; yellow like a Jewish <i>Challah</i>; it can be buttered, toasted,
made into bread crumbs, spread with jams &amp; jellies, made into sandwiches,
stuffed with meats, flavored with herbs &amp; spices, flattened and baked
with toppings, or sweetened for a dessert. Bread is indeed remarkable!</b>
<p><b>In the Middle Ages, bread assumed as important a role as it does
today. Everyone, even the poorest peasant, ate some form of bread, and
there was a thriving industry of millers &amp; bakers that served the needs
of the Medieval populace. Bread was considered such an important commodity
that harsh laws concerning its production existed, and a baker found guilty
of making insubstantial loaves would be jailed or corporally punished.
An honest baker would be guaranteed a good living from his guild, and an
income secured by contract. In 1303, a The London Bakers Company assured
their bakers a profit allowance that covered the cost of wood, candles,
journeymen &amp; apprentices, salt, yeast, the miller's charges, the baker's
house, a dog, a cat, and a wife.</b>
<p><b>The average person, on the whole, did not bake their own bread. Those
that grew grain &amp; wheat would take it to a miller for processing, then
take the flour to a baker; others merely purchased their bread directly
from a baker's stall or shop. Even millers purchased their bread: in <i>The
Canterbury Tales</i>, the Miller sends his daughter into town to purchase
a loaf when company unexpectedly arrives. Because of this commercial availability
of bread, few recipes were copied or placed in the cookbooks of the day;
those that do survive show that the technique of breadmaking has changed
very little over the centuries, and except for quality of ingredients,
a loaf homemade today is very much like those of yesterday. In Medieval
times, loaves were generally round, with a cross-shape cut in the top.</b>
<p><b>Bread varied from class to class; the poor ate coarsely ground dark
bread, while the rich consumed a much more sophisticated product. White
was the best, and <i>Pandemayne</i> was the finest of the white breads
made. My version of <i>Pandemayne</i> is one of my favorite white bread
recipes, which I use in all my feasts &amp; Medieval dinners. I always
bake my loaves round, but sometimes leave a personal touch instead of the
traditional cross on top: I often make three slashes, in symbolism of the
Trinity. The word <i>Pandemayne</i> is French in origin, and survives today
as <i>pain</i>, the modern French word for bread.</b>

<p><b><font size=-1>ABOUT THIS RECIPE:</font></b>
<p><b>This is very much a 20th century recipe; however, as stated earlier,
very few recipes for bread survive from the Medieval period, and what information
we do have tells us that, except for differences in the leavening agent
and the types of ingredients used, basic bread-making has remained essentially
the same throughout the ages. This recipe will provide you with an excellent
white bread that would have been considered very fine fare in the Middle
Ages. For an authentic period bread recipe from the Middle Ages, please
see David Friedman's translation located on this site at: <a href="../friends/frec110.htm">On
Bread. Platina Book 1</a>.</b>

and let rise until doubled. Punch down. Let rise again until doubled. Cut
in portions. Shape each in a smooth ball. Cover; let rest 10 minutes. Shape
