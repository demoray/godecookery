cook and his staff turned the meat - pork,
beef, mutton, poultry, game - on a <a

and prepared stews and soups in <a

iron cauldrons hung over the fire on a hook and chain</a> that could be
raised and lowered to regulate the temperature. Boiled meat was lifted
out of the pot with an <a href="../afeast/kitchens/kit015.html">iron
meat
hook</a>, a long fork with a wooden handle and prongs attached to the
side.
Soup was stirred with a long-handled slotted spoon.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><br>
Meat preservation was by
salting or smoking, or, most commonly and
simply, by keeping the meat alive till needed. Salting was done by two
methods. Dry-salting meant burying the meat in a bed of salt pounded to
a powder with mortar and pestle. Brine-curing consisted of immersing
the
meat in a strong salt solution. Before cooking, the salted meat had to
be soaked and rinsed.<br>
      <br>
      </b></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In addition to roasting and
stewing, meat might be pounded to a paste,
mixed with other ingredients, and served as a kind of custard. A dish
of
this kind was <a href="../goderec/grec34.htm">blankmanger</a>,
consisting
of a paste of chicken blended with rice boiled in almond milk, seasoned
with sugar, cooked until very thick, and garnished with fried almonds
and
anise. Another was <a href="../goderec/grec35.htm">mortrews</a>, of
fish
or meat that was pounded, mixed with bread crumbs, stock, and eggs, and
poached, producing a kind of <i>quenelle</i>, or dumpling. Both meat
and
fish were also made into pies, pasties, and fritters.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Sauces were made from herbs
from the castle garden that were ground
to a paste, mixed with wine, verjuice (the juice of unripe grapes),
vinegar,
onions, ginger, pepper, saffron, cloves, and cinnamon. Mustard, a
favorite
ingredient, was used by the gallon.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In Lent or on fast days fish
was served fresh from the castle's own
pond, from a nearby river, or from the sea, nearly always with a highly
seasoned sauce. Salt or smoked herring was a staple, as were salted or
dried cod or stockfish. Fresh herring, flavored with ginger, pepper,
and
cinnamon, might be made into a pie. Other popular fish included mullet,
shad, sole, flounder, plaice, ray, mackeral, salmon, and trout.
Sturgeon,
whale, and porpoise were rare seafood delicacies, the first two <i>"royal
fish,"</i> fit for kings and queens. Pike, crab, crayfish, oysters, and
eels were also favorites. A royal order to the sheriff in Gloucester in
the 1230s stated that:</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"...since after lampreys
all fish seem insipid to both the king
and the queen, the sheriff shall procure by purchase or otherwise as
many
lampreys as possible in his bailiwick, place them in bread and jelly,
and
send them to the king while he is at a distance from those parts by
John
of Sandon, the king's cook, who is being sent to him. When the king
comes
nearer, he shall send them to him fresh."</i></b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The most common vegetables,
besides onions and garlic, were peas
and beans. Staples of the diet of the poor, for the rich they might be
served with onions and saffron. Honey, commonly used for sweetening,
came
from castle or manor beas; fruit from the castle orchard - apples,
pears,
plums, and peaches - was supplemented by wild fruits and nuts from the
lord's wood. In addition to these local products, there were imported
luxuries
such as sugar (including a special kind made with roses and violets),
rice,
almonds, figs, dates, raisins, oranges, and pomegranates, purchased in
town or at the fairs. Ordinary sugar was bought by the loaf and had to
be pounded; powdered white sugar was more expensive.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>At mealtimes, servants set
up the trestle tables and spread the cloths,
setting steel knives, silver spoons, dishes for salt, silver cups, and
mazers - shallow silver-rimmed wooden bowls. At each place was a <a
 href="../how2cook/howto07.htm">trencher</a>
or manchet, a thick slice of day-old bread serving as a plate for the
roast
meat. Meals were announced by a horn blown to signal time for washing
hands.
Servants with ewers, basins, and towels attended the guests.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>At the table, seating
followed status: The most important guests
were at the high table, with the loftiest place reserved for an
ecclesiastical
dignitary, the second for the ranking layman. After grace, the
procession
of servants bearing food began. First came the pantler with the bread
and
butter, followed by the butler and his assistants with the wine and
beer.
Wine, in thirteenth century England mostly imported from English-ruled
Bourdeaux, was drunk young in the absence of an effective technique for
stoppering containers. Wine kept a year became undrinkable. No
attention
was paid to vintage, and often what was served even at rich tables was
of poor quality. Peter of Blois decribed in a letter wine served at
Henry
II's court:</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><i>"The wine is turned sour
or mouldy - thick, greasy, stale, flat
and smacking of pitch. I have sometimes seen even great lords served
with
wine so muddy that a man must needs close his eyes and clench his
teeth,
wry-mouthed and shuddering, and filtering the stuff rather than
drinking."</i></b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The castle bought wine by
the barrel and decanted it into jugs. Some
was spiced and sweetened by the butlers to go with the final course.
Ale,
made from barley, wheat, or oats, or all three, was drunk mainly by the
servants. A castle household brewed its own, hiring an ale-wife for the
task and using grain from its own stores. At the royal court, according
to Peter of Blois, the ale was not much better than the wine - it was <i>"horrid
to the taste and abominable to the sight."</i></b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ceremony marked the service
at table. There was a correct way to
do everything, from the laying of cloths to the cutting of trenchers
and
carving of meat. Part of a squire's training was learning how to serve
his lord at meals: the order in which dishes should be presented, where
they should be placed, how many fingers to use in holding the joint for
the lord to carve, how to cut the trenchers and place them on the table.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The solid parts of soups and
stews were eaten with a spoon, the broth
sipped. Meat was cut up with the knife and eaten with the fingers. Two
persons shared a dish, the lesser helping the more important, the
younger
the older, the man the woman. The former in each case broke the bread,
cut the meat, and passed the cup.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Etiquette books admonished
diners not to leave the spoon in the dish
or put elbows on the table, not to belch, not to drink or eat with
their
mouths full, not to stuff their mouths or take overly large helpings.
Not
surprisingly,in light of the finger-eating and dish-sharing, stress was
laid on keeping hands and nails scrupulously clean, wiping spoon and
knife
after use, wiping the mouth before drinking, and not dipping meat in
the
salt dish.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The lord and lady were at
pains to see their guests amply served.
Bishop Robert Grosseteste advised the countess of Lincoln to make sure
that her servants were judiciously distributed during dinner, that they
entered the room in an orderly way and avoided quarreling. <i>"Especially
do you yourself keep watch over the service until the meats are placed
in the hall, and then... command that your dish be so refilled and
heaped
up, and especially with the light dishes, that you may courteously give
from your dish to all the high table on the right and on the left."</i>
At his own house, he reminded the countess, guests were served at
dinner
with two meats and two lighter dishes. Between courses, the steward
should
send the servers into the kitchen and see to it that they brought in
the
meats quietly and without confusion.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>An everyday dinner, served
between 10:00 A.M. and noon, comprised
two or three courses, each of several separate dishes, all repeating
the
same kinds of food except the last course, which consisted of fruits,
nuts,
cheese, wafers, and spiced wine.</b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>On such festive occasions as
holidays and weddings, fantastic quantites
of food were consumed. When Henry III's daughter married the king of
Scotland
on Christmas Day 1252 at York, Matthew Paris reported that <i>"more
than
sixty pasture cattle formed the first and principal course at table...
the gift of the archbishop. The guests feasted by turns with one king
at
one time, at another time with the other, who vied with one another in
preparing costly meals."</i> As for the entertaimnent, the number and
apparel
of guests, the variety of foods: <i>"If I were more fully to describe
(them)...
the relation would appear hyperbolical in the ears of those not
present,
and would give rise to ironical remarks."</i> Such feasts included
boar's
heads, venison, peacocks, swans, suckling pigs, cranes, plovers, and
larks.</b><b><i><u><font size="-1"><br>
