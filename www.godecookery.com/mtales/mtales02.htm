      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="-1"><big></big></font>Many
medieval miracles centered around the belief in the power of
the Virgin Mary, who favored those who paid devotion to her. Such an
example
is the fable of the knight who, after having entered the monastery of
Citeaux,
could learn only the <i>Ave Maria</i> and constantly repeated it. At
his
death a <i>fleur-de-lis</i> grew from his grave, on every flower of
which
appeared in gold the words <i>Ave Maria</i>.</b><br>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>A
robber-knight, who daily said an <i>Ave</i>, robbed a holy man.
The holy man then told the knight that he had a secret to tell him, but
only in front of his entire household. All assembled except the
Chamberlain,
who was sent for. When he finally arrived, the holy man forced him to
confess
that he was actually a devil in disguise, waiting for the day when the
knight might forget his <i>Ave</i>, and the devil could then drag him
off
to hell.</b><br>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>A
bishop suspended a priest because he could say no other Mass than
that of the Virgin. She appeared to the bishop and told him that he
must
reinstate the priest within thirty days or he would die. In terror the
bishop obeyed, and begged the priest to never sing any other Mass.</b><br>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Evagrius (sixth century) and
Gregory of Tours tell a story, of which
there are many versions, showing how the Virgin was regarded as a
protector.
A Jewish child had received Communion with others in a church of the
Virgin.
His father threw him into a furnace. His mother rushed out to help. The
boy, who was drawn unhurt from the furnace, into which his father was
later
thrown, said that the woman whom he had seen with a Child in the
basilica
had covered him with Her mantle to protect him against the fire.</b><br>
      </div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>When
famine struck a monastery dedicated to the Virgin, the abbot
bade the monks to pray to Her all night. The next morning the barns
were
filled to overflowing, and this miracle occurred several years running.</b><br>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><b>A
poor knight sold his wife to the Devil for great riches. When she
was taken to meet the Devil by her husband, she was filled with great
fear
and fled to a church, where she commended herself to the Virgin. As she
prayed she slept, and the Virgin took the appearnace of the woman and
went
with the knight. When they met the devil he reproached the knight for
bringing
the Virgin instead of the wife. The Virgin sent the Devil away,
forbidding
him to have power over those who called on Her. She bade the knight to
cast away his wealth, and then, dwelling in Her praise, he received
many
riches from Her.<br>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A
popular medieval story concerned a Flemish monk who was painting
a picture of heaven and hell on the portals of his abbey. He was
engaged
in portraying the devil as hideously as possible when His Satanic
Majesty,
appearing in person, begged the monk to paint him as a young and
handsome
man. The monk refused and the angry Devil pulled away the scaffold on
which
the artist was working. But as the monk fell, a statue of the Virgin,
in
a niche below the portal, stretched out her arms and held him in safety
until help arrived.</span><br>
