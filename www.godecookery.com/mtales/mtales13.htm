      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Inns appeared in England in
the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
and were apparently fairly common, especially in towns, by the
fifteenth
century. The earliest buildings still standing today, such as New Inn,
Gloucester, or King's Head, Aylesbury, date from this time. While inns
provided lodgings for travelers, taverns were drinking houses seeking
to cater for the more prosperous levels of society. The leading
taverners
in larger towns were themselves vintners or acted as agents for
vintners.
The Vintner's Company of London, for instance, secured an essential
monopoly
of the retail trade in the city in 1364. A tavern of the later Medieval
period might be imagined as a fairly substantial building of several
rooms
and a generous cellar. Taverns had signs to advertise their presence to
potential customers, and branches and leaves would be hung over the
door
to give notice that wine could be purchased. Some taverns sold wine as
their only beverage, and a customer could also purchase food brought in
from a convenient cook-shop. Taverns seldom offered lodgings or very
elaborate
feasting, such as would be expected at inns. Pastimes like gambling,
singing,
and seeking prostitutes were a more common part of the tavern scene.<br>

adult recreation of the
villagers was undoubtedly drinking. Both men and women gathered in the
"tavern," usually meaning the house of a neighbor who had recently
brewed a batch of ale, cheap at the established price of three gallons
for a penny. There they passed the evening like modern villagers
visiting the local pub. Accidents, quarrels, and acts of violence
sometimes followed a session of drinking, in the thirteenth century as
well as subsequent ones. Some misadventures may be deduced from the
terse manorial court records. The rolls of the royal coroners,
reporting fatal accidents, spell out many in graphic detail: In 1276 in
Elstow, Osbert le Wuayl, son of William Cristmasse, coming home at
about midnight "Drunk and disgustingly over-fed," after an evening in
Bedford, fell and struck his head fatally on a stone "breaking the
whole of his head." One man stumbled off his horse riding home from the
tavern; another fell into a well in the marketplace and drowned; a
third, relieving himself in a pond, fell in; still another, carrying a
pot of ale down the village street, was bitten by a dog, tripped while
picking up a stone to throw, and struck his head against a wall; a
child slipped from her drunken mother's lap into a pan of hot milk on
the hearth.<br>
            <br>
One village craft was so widely practiced that it hardly belonged to
craftsmen. Every village not only had its brewers, but had them all up
and down the street. Many if not most of them were women. Ale was as
necessary to life in an English medieval village as bread, but where
flour-grinding and bread-baking were strictly guarded seigneurial
monopolies, brewing was everywhere freely permitted and freely
practiced. How the lords came to overlook this active branch of
industry is a mystery (though they found a way to profit from it by
fining the brewers for weak ale or faulty measure). Not only barley
(etymologically related to beer) but oats and wheat were used, along
with malt, as principal ingredients. The procedure was to make a batch
of ale, display a sign, and turn one's house into a temporary tavern.
Some equipment was needed, principally a large cauldron, but this did
not prevent poor women from brewing. All twenty-three persons indicted
by Elton village ale tasters in 1279 were women. Seven were pardoned
because they were poor.<br>
