      <b>Tales of miracles involving the Host, or sacramental wafer
used
in Catholic services, were common in the Middle Ages. A story told in
various
forms in the 12th &amp; 13th centuries involved a peasant who owned
bees
which were dying in great numbers. He was advised to place the Host
among
them, which would halt the disease and attract other bees to the hive.
This was done, but then the bees, recognizing their Lord, built a
little
church of wax with an altar on which they laid the Host, and gathered
around
it making a wondrous melody. When the peasant discovered this, the bees
stung him. A priest was called for and a miracle was declared. When all
the parish had seen the marvel, the structure and the Host were carried
to the church, the bees flying in ecstasy around it. In a variant of
this
tale, a peasant hid the Host in a tree and the same sort of marvelous
manifestation
happened. This church had tower and bells, with altar, chalice, and
paten,
and it was sent round the diocese, then to the Archbishop, the Emperor,
and the Pope.<br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Host was also used as a
love-charm, sometimes with foul words
written around it, or with evil prayers intercalated at Mass. In 1273,
a woman, to regain her husband's love, placed the Host, laid upon a
tile,
on live coals. It then became flesh, dripping blood. She buried it in a
heap of manure, where it remained for seven years. Meanwhile wonderful
things happened, and the woman at last confessed to a priest, who found
the flesh and blood intact. They were preserved for many years,
uncorrupt
and undissolved, as precious relics.</b></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Jacques de Vitry has a story
of a woman who intended to use the Host
as a love-charm. She retained it in her mouth, but it changed to flesh
and adhered to her palate, so that she could not speak. A licentious
priest
also kept the Host in his mouth, intending to kiss a woman and bend her
to his will through its power. Leaving the church, he became so tall
that
he struck his head on the roof. In terror he drew the Host from his
mouth
and concealed it. Then, going to another priest, he confessed. Both
then
went to the place of concealment and found a small figure of a crucifix
made of flesh and blood.</b></p>

In the modern Catholic
church, a <i>Pyx</i> (from the Latin word <i>pyxis</i>, meaning box)
refers to the vessel used to carry the
Host
to the ill. In earlier times, however, the term was applied to all
containers
which held the Eucharist. The pyx is an attribute of St. Clare of
Assisi
who, according to legend, placed a pyx containing the Host on the
threshold
of her convent which was under attack. The beseiging infidels
immediately
threw down their weapons and fled, and a miracle was proclaimed.<br>

In the Middle Ages, Rocamadour in France was one of the more famous
pilgrim centers. There the sword <i>Durandal</i>, which had belonged
to
Roland, was treasured. Here too, besides relics of saints, votive
offerings
brought by the faithful were found in abundance. Jewels, rich
vestments,
&amp; gold and silver ornaments had been deposited over the years to
win
the favor of heaven for their donors, along with numerous tresses of
women's
hair, reminders of a story long associated with the shrine. A woman
pilgrim,
famed for her beauty, had through loose living become blind. On the way
to Rocamadour she prayed to the Virgin that her sight might be
restored.
This was granted, but on her arrival, she was not allowed to enter the
shrine. While she was confessing her sins outside to a priest, he
looked
at her fair face and said, <i>"Dear friend, I fear these lovely
tresses
of yours have done great hurt to those who have gazed at them. Offer
them
now in honor of God and our Lady."</i> The tresses were cut and carried
into church on a pole and there placed with others, similarily
surrendered.
The lady followed, to give thanks to the Virgin for her salvation. But
on the homeward journey, like Lot's wife, the shorn beauty looked
regretfully
back, bemoaning the loss of her hair and wishing she had it again. Her
wish was immediately granted, but with her hair her blindness also
returned.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Robert
Manning tells the tale of a woman who lived with a "right amorous
priest" for many years and bore four sons, three of whom became
priests, the fourth a scholar. After their father died, the four sons
urged the mother to repent her "deadly sin." The mother, however,
declared that she would never repent "while I have you three priests to
pray and chant for me and to bring me to bliss." The mother died
"sooner than she willed." For three nights her sons sat by her body at
the wake. On the first, at midnight, to their terror, "the bier began
to quake." On the second night it quaked again and suddenly a devil
appeared, seized the corpse, and dragged it toward the door. The sons
sprang up, carried it back, and tied it to the bier. On the third night
at midnight a whole host of fiends invaded the house and</span><br>

The scholar son then roamed the world advising women not to become
"priests' mares," less they suffer his mother's fate.<br>
