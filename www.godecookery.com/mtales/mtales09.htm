      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Our word Christmas is derived
from the Middle English usage "Christ's
Mass," and central to the celebration of the Nativity was the
liturgical
activity which had been established by the year 600, and did not change
in the Middle Ages. In Medieval England there were, in fact, three
Masses
celebrated on Christmas Day. The first and most characteristic was at
midnight
(the Angel's Mass), catching up the notion that the light of salvation
appeared at the darkest moment of the darkest date in the very depth of
winter. The second Christmas Mass came at dawn (the Shepherd's Mass),
and
the third during the day (the Mass of the Divine Word). The season of
Advent,
the forty days of leading up to Christmas, was being observed in the
Western
Church by the year 500. St. Nicholas was a very popular Medieval saint,
and his feast day came in Advent (6 December), but he did not play his
part in Christmas as Santa Claus until after the Reformation.<br>

            <td style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;"><b>Also
important in the celebration of Christmas was the banquet, which
necessarily varied in sumptuosness with the resources of the
celebrants.
The menu varied with soups and stews, birds and fish, breads and
puddings,
but a common element was the Yule boar, an animal for those who could
afford
it or a pie shaped like a boar for more humble tables. Churches and
houses
were decorated with ivy, mistletoe, holly, or anything green, which
remained
up until the eve of Candlemass. The gift-giving of the season was
represented
by the New Year Gift, which continued a tradition of Roman origin. The
later Christmas present was not part of a Medieval Christmas. The sorts
of things that people might have done to entertain themselves at
Christmas
apart from eating is succintly summarized in a letter written by
Margaret
Paston on Christmas Eve 1459 after she had inquired how her Norfolk
neighbour,
Lady Morley, had conducted her household in mourning the previous
Christmas,
just after Lady Morley had been widowed:<br>
            <br>
            </b><b><i>"...there were no disguisings [acting], nor
harping, luting
or singing, nor any lewd sports, but just playing at the tables
[backgammon]
and chess and cards. Such sports she gave her folk leave to play and no
other."</i></b><br>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Mention of disguising calls to
mind the Christmas cycle of the mystery
plays, which were part of late Medieval urban entertainment in
different
parts of England. The Shepherd's Play from Wakefield would be a
specific
example. Mention by Lady Morley of <i>"lewd sport"</i> is possibly
a reference to the carol-dance. The leader of the dance sang a verse of
the carol, and a ring of dancers responded with the chorus.
Carol-dances
were often suggestive of their pagan ancestors where, for instance,
holly
and ivy had fertility associations with male and female. Further music
for the celebration of the season was provided by the Latin hymns of
the
Church.<br>

            <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>A medieval Christmas
celebration was not over in a day, but continued
until 6 January (the Egyptian winter solstice), the Feast of the
Epiphany
on the 12th day after Christmas Day. Epiphany celebrated the visit of
the
wise men, the Magi, around whom many layers of legend accumulated as
they
came to be conceptualized as three oriental kings who visited the
infant
Christ at Bethlehem in Judaea. Epiphany also symbolized the
manifestation
of Christ to the Gentiles. The Monday after Epiphany was called Plough
Monday, and it was then that ploughing began.</b></div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The day after Christmas
recalled St. Stephen, the martyr mentioned
in the New Testament book of Acts. The following day was that of John
the
Apostle and Evangelist (not to be confused with John the Baptist), and
28 December was Holy Innocents' Day or Childermas Day, commemorating
the
male children killed by Herod, who was king of the Jews when Jesus was
born. It was superstition that the day of the week upon which Holy
Innocents'
Day fell would be unlucky for the coming year.</b></p>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>There was no absolute
standard about ending the Christmas season
with Epiphany, and many carried it through to forty days after
Christmas,
the date of an ancient pagan festival on 2 February. This is now
celebrated
as Candlemas, or the Feast of the Purification of the Virgin, or
alternatively
as the Presentation of the Infant Jesus in the Temple. In one of the
most
elaborate processions of the year, all parishioners came to Mass with a
penny and a candle blessed before the procession, both of which were
offered
to the priest as part of the parochial duties of the faithful. Other
candles
were blessed and taken away by the faithful to be used for such things
as giving comfort during thunder storms or while sick or even dying.
Such
candles were thus important for giving people a light of solace in the
face of hostile forces and stressful events. And thus Candlemas was a
closure
for the long season commencing with Advent that drew Medieval
Christians
to concentrate on the miraculous gift to humanity of Christ, and the
promise
of salvation, while leaving at the same time space for fun, feasting,
and
socializing.</b><b><i><u><font size="-1"><br>
