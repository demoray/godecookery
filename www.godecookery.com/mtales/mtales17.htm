 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
The inhabitants of monastic houses were among the most diligent
of Medieval gardeners. It is told in Genesis, the first book of the Old
Testament, that God created a garden in Eden, a lovely place with
multitudes
of plants and trees. Adam and Eve's sin of disobedience which caused
their
exile became for Christians the Doctrine of the Fall of Humanity, and
the
tradition grew in succeeding human generations that one avenue for
seeking
associaiton with God was by gardening. An obvious venue for spiritual
gardening
was the monastery. The monastic rule of St. Benedict, drawn up in the
sixth
century for his community at Monte Cassino in Italy, was profoundly
influential
in England, and the Benedictine Rule specifically enjoined the
cultivation
of gardens.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any monastery, Benedictine or
otherwise, would require a kitchen
garden, or gardens, depending on the size of the house. The kitchen
garden
would probably lie within a hedge or wall and would produce peas and
beans
required for the daily pottage, together with leeks, onions, and
garlic.
Larger gardens might also produce apples and other fruits, have
beehives
for the production of honey, and grow hemp. Hemp (cannabis) was
introduced
into England by the Romans, not as a drug but for the making of rope
and
canvas, and was for this reason vital to a useful Medieval industry.</span><b><br>
      <br>
The garden for a monastic infirmary would probably have been smaller
than the kitchen garden and more specialized. Here would have been
grown
the ingredients required for medicine, salves, and tonics. The modern
word
"drug" is derived from the Old English verb <i>"driggen"</i> meaning
to
dry, reflecting the preparation undertaken by the infirmarer of the
herbs
that he would store for use in his service to the sick. The infirmary
garden
at Westminster Abbey covered an acre, and would have offered space for
convalescents to stroll among the beds of assorted herbs and flowers
grown
for their medicinal properties while enjoying gentle exercise in
scented
air. It may be noted in passing that the substantial garden maintained
by the cellarer of Westminster Abbey was at a distance from the main
buildings
of the abbey at a location now known as Covent Garden, from the Norman
French <i>"Le Couvent"</i> or "The Convent," while the orchard of the
abbey
is memorialized by Abbey Orchard Street.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>In London by the reign of
Edward I there existed a nursary trade
to supply the needs and desires of gardeners. One could buy such things
as seeds of leeks, mustard, hemp, colewort, and onions, as well as
onion
sets, other small plants, and grafted fruit trees. An organized nursary
trade was also appearing around the same time in such places as Oxford,
Norwich, and York. Itinerant seedsmen moving about from place to place
with their packhorses filled in the gaps between organized commercial
centres.
A trade in the surplus produce of household gardens also existed. One
market
for such surplus and for the produce of market gardens in the later
Middle
Ages was in London in front of the church of St. Augustine, Watling
Street,
close to St. Paul's churchyard.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Pleasure gardens, too, were
a feature of some monasteries, planted
with trees, shrubs, and vines. The cloister garth of a monastery would
commonly be planted with trees, herbs, and flowers to make them more
pleasant
for contemplative recreation. Even more appropriate to contemplation
would
have been a paradise, inspired by the Garden of Eden described in
Genesis
2:8-9. It was the custom that paradises were enclosed and used for
prayer
and meditation. The sacrist of the monastery saw to it that the
paradise
produced the flowers needed to decorate the church for various
occasions,
and such devotional flowers as roses and lilies would certainly have
been
grown there. When a monastery was able to establish a paradise, it was
usually placed beside the monk's cemetery, normally north of the
church,
and itself decorated with trees, flowers, and fountains, together with
a central cross or crucufix. Even heads of monastic institutions
sometimes
established private gardens, which reflected personal tastes and
interests
in favourite fruit trees, shade-giving trees, herbs, flowers, or
vegetables.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>CARTHUSIAN GARDENING</u></b></div>
      <ul>
        <p> </p>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>The cloistered religious
orders of England made an ongoing contribution
to the tradition of gardening, but among the monks and nuns a special
niche
in the history of English Medieval gardening was filled by Carthusian
monks.
Because of the disciplined nature of their lives all Carthusians were
gardeners.
The Carthusian Order began in 1084 when Bruno, a priest and head of the
cathedral school and chancellor of the diocese of Rheims, in his mature
years founded the Grande Chartreuse in Provence. In Carthusian houses,
or charterhouses as they were called in England, the monks lived lives
of strict asceticism and solitude, each one residing in a separate
cell,
very much like a private house, within the monastery precincts. The
brethren
gathered each day to participate in collective worship, but they ate
together
only on important feastdays. They followed a common daily schedule, but
lived essentially as recluses. They prayed, studied, ate, and worked
for
the most part within the small world of their cells and gardens, each
one
following his own programme of cultivation.</b><b><i><u><font size="-1"><br>
