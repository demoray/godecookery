parents have been accused by certain modern writers of a want of
feeling toward their children, but even in the comparative poverty of
the kind of literary expressions - correspondence and memoirs - that
have recorded such sentiments for more recent times, the charge
scarcely stands up. Between the lines in the accounts of the coroners
may be read again and again the anguish of parents over a lost child:
one father searching for his son, drowned in a ditch, "found him,
lifted him from the water, could not save him, and he died"; another,
whose son was struck by lightning in a field, "came running toward him,
found him lying there, took him in his arms to the house... thinking to
save him"; a mother dragged her son out of a ditch "because she
believed she could save him"; a father whose son fell into the millpond
"tried to save [him] and entered the water but could do nothing."
Sometimes peasants gave their lives for their children, as in one case
when a father was killed defending his young daughter from rape.</span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;A
fourteenth-century sermon pictures a mother and her child: "In winter,
when the child's hands are cold, the mother takes him to a straw or
rush and bids him warm it, not for love of the straw, to warm it, but
to warm the child's hands [by pressing them together]." When the child
falls ill, "the mother for her sick child takes a candle, and makes a
vow in prayers."<br>
      <br>
The coroner's rolls yield rare glimpses of children at work and play:
the baby in the cradle by the fire; little girls following their
mothers around, helping to stir the pot, draw water, gather fruit;
little boys following their father to the fields, to the mill, or
fishing, or playing with bows and arrows. A sermon pictures a child
using his imagination, playing "with flowers... with sticks, and with
small bits of wood, to build a chamber, buttery, and hall, to make a
white horse of a wand, a sailing ship of broken bread, a burly spear
from a ragwort stalk, and of a sedge a sword of war, a comely lady of
cloth, and be right busy to deck elegantly with flowers."<br>
      <br>
A child, said one preacher, did not bear malice, "nor rancor nor wrath
toward those that beat him ever so sorely, as it happened for a child
to have due chastening. But after thou hast beaten him, show him a fair
flower or else a fair red apple; then he hath forgotten all that was
done to him before, and then he will come to thee, running, with his
embracing arms, to please thee and to kiss thee."<br>
      <br>
Small children played; older ones did chores. In their teens, both boys
and girls moved into an adult work world, the girls in and around the
house, the boys in the fields. Contrary to what was formerly believed,
in this period village children were not ordinarily sent away to become
servants in other people's households or to be apprenticed at a craft.
Most remained at home.<br>

In the village as in castle and city, babies were born at home, their
birth attended by midwives. Men were excluded from the lying-in
chamber. Literary evidence suggests that the woman in labor assumed a
sitting or crouching position. Childbirth was dangerous for both mother
and child. The newborn infant was immediately prepared for baptism,
lest it die in a state of original sin. If a priest could not be
located in time, someone else must perform the ceremony, a contingency
for which water must be kept ready. If the baptizer did not know the
formula in Latin, he must say it in English or French: "I christen thee
in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen."<br>
      <br>
The words must be said in the right order. If the baptizer said, "In
the name of the Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost," the sacrament
wa invalid. Robert Manning told the story of a midwife who said the
wrong words:<br>
      <br>
      </big></small></span>
      <div style="margin-left: 320px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>She
held it on her lap before,</big></small></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>And when she saw
that it would die,</big></small></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>She began loud for
to cry,</big></small></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>And said, "God and
Saint John,</big></small></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>Christen the child
both flesh and bone."</big></small></span><br>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big><br>
When the priest heard the formula she had used, he cried, "God and
Saint John give thee both sorrow and shame... for in default a soul is
lost," and he commanded her no longer to deliver babies. Robert Manning
concluded,<br>
      <br>
      </big></small></span>
      <div style="margin-left: 320px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>Being
a midwife is a perilous thing</big></small></span><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big>Unless she knows the
points of christening.</big></small></span><br>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><small><big><br>
John Myre in his <span style="font-style: italic;">Instructions for
Parish Priests</span> (early fifteenth century) advised that if the
baby seemed likely to die, "though the child but half be born/ Head and
neck and no more," the midwife should "christen it and cast on water."
If the mother died before the child could be born, the midwife mist
free the child with a knife, to save its life, or at least to assure
baptism.<br>
