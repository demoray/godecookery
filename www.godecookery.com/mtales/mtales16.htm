      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>An observer of English
society today would likely notice the cultivation
of gardens, an activity for which the Medieval tradition is also
evident.
With gardening, it is not always easy to distinguish between pleasure
and
utility. Any space in which people were deliberately cultivating plants
we can call a garden, and we might go on to categorize the kitchen
garden,
where some vegetables and herbs might be grown for their edible produce
as well as for building and fuel or as habitat for animals which could
be hunted; the physic garden, wherein would be planted various
medicinal
herbs; or the aesthetic garden, developed largely for ornament and
pleasure.
Yet we must not be overly rigid about categories, because to the
gardener
a plot of ground might blissfully intermingle recreational, aesthetic,
and practical purposes. One of the things most appreciated about the
flowers
in a garden was their sweet fragrance. Because Medieval gardens were
frequently
enclosed, the fragrances of flowers and herbs were confined and
concentrated.</b><b><br>
      <br>
A description of an enclosed garden comes from the pen of Reginald,
a monk of Durham, who wrote the <i>Life and Miracles of St. Godric</i>.
Godric, who died in 1170, was a hermit at Finchale a few miles from
Durham.
In the <i>Life</i>, a square garden is described surrounded on all
sides
by a hedge. At the centre of the garden (where in other gardens one
might
expect to find a fountain, pool, or special tree or plant) there was a
desk upon which rested a book from which a man was reading. The garden
is described as being laid out on a quadrangular plan, suggesting that
it was divided into four quarters, each of which was an area of
planting,
and that the quarters were marked off with some sort of dividing
boundaries.
Such qualities as aroma, especially if concentrated in an enclosure,
together
with visual beauty and practical use, gave value to garden plants.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>USEFUL GARDEN PLANTS</u></b>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Among the useful garden flowers might be mentioned those of
the <i>artemisia</i>
family. Southernwood's (<i>Artemisia abrotanum</i>) hair-like leaves
were
used to relieve fevers and wounds and, when dried, the plant was valued
for its aroma. The ability to purge a person of worms and poisons was
attributed
to wormwood (<i>Artemisia absinthum</i>), which was also respected as a
cure for constipation and stomach discomfort, to say nothing of its
value
as flea repellent (shared by pennyroyal, one of the mints, but not a
garden
flower). Wormwood has a bitter taste, unlike mugwort (<i>Artemisia
vulgaris</i>),
which was used to add flavour to drinks. The tansy flower was thought
to
be an insect repellent, but the entire plant is aromatic and bitter to
the taste, and all parts of the plant were variously used in cookery.
Another
useful flower was the marigold, named St. Mary's Gold to honour the
Virgin
Mary. Marigolds were used both as a medicine, against stings and
pestilence,
and in cooking, as a bitter spice. The blue iris, still a greatly
appreciated
flower, had many uses. The iris root made a decent ink and, when dried,
had a sweet aroma, reminiscent of violets. Iris leaves could be used in
making mats, patching thatched roofs, or like rushes in covering
floors.
Furthermore, the iris was not only fragrant and pleasing to the eye,
but
yielded a dark blue juice that was used for spot removing, as a salve
for
teeth and gums, and as an ingredient in a dye for cloth. Beautiful,
useful,
and sweet-smelling, it is no wonder that the iris was a favourite
flower.</b> <br>
      <b><br>
Another useful and favourite flower was the periwinkle. Periwinkle
garlands and wreaths could easily be woven because of the long, supple
stems, and the plant grew low, making it a useful and attractive ground
cover. Medieval English people were not attracted to lawns that aspired
to the appearance of the modern golf course. They liked flowery meads
of
scythe-mown grass, fragrant herbs, and flowers like violets, daisies,
primroses,
and periwinkles, which acted as a summons to walk, dance, and lie among
the visual beauty and enveloping aromas. Violets were popular, but were
appreciated for more than just their fragrance. They were associated
symbolically
with humility, freshness, purity, and innocence, and thus came to be
associated
with the Blessed Virgin. Products of the kitchen were sometimes
garnished
and coloured with violets, while the petals had a medicinal use as an
emetic
and purgative, and the oil could scent a bath or soothe the skin. Like
periwinkles, daisies were made into garlands and crowns, and were
welcomed
in gardens. The bright freshness of the daisy is suggested by its name,
which comes from the Old English <i>daezeseye</i> or eye of day. Among
the varieties, the large ox-eye was the favourite. The primrose was
also
popular, and was appreciated in a part, as it still is, because of its
early appearance in the spring. The primrose was also very useful. It
could
be made into wine. The leaves were used on wounds to ease pain and on
the
skin to avoid blemishes, and they were eaten to ease muscle aches. The
petals were also eaten for pain relief, cooked into tansy cakes and
pottages,
and floated in comforting baths.</b> <br>
      <b><br>
The gillyflower, ancestor of the carnation, was another flower
respected
for its usefulness and attractiveness. It was used in cooking as a
spice
because of its aroma and clove-like taste, and was used to cover the
bitter
taste of some medical potions as well as a flavouring in wine and ale.
The gillyflower apparently came to England with the Normans, and by the
fourteenth century was to be found in the colour of flesh pink,
crimson,
and white, while by the next century there was also a clove pink
variety,
the one with the most assertive aroma and colour. The peony, thought of
today as simply an ornamental flower, had additional uses in centuries
past. The seeds were used in flavouring meat, or were eaten raw to warm
the tastebuds and stabilize the temperament; they were also drunk in
hot
wine and ale before retiring at night to avoid disturbing dreams. The
pink,
red, and white flowers of the <i>Paeonia mascula</i> can be seen today
essentially as they were centuries ago on the island of Steep Holme off
the north Somerset coast at the site of an Augustinian priory which
existed
only for a few decades in the thirteenth century. The conditions on the
island were clearly better for the peonies than for the Augustinians.
Less
spectacular by far than the flower of the peony was that of sweet
woodruff,
which can conclude our sampling of useful flowers. It was frequently
used
for garlands, with its fresh, sweet fragrance and white summery colour,
and also to add subtlety to drinks, while the leaves, so scented that
they
were known as "sweetgrass," were strewn when dry on floors and packed
with
clothes as a freshener.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b><u>FLOWERS FOR PLEASURE<br>
      </u></b>&nbsp;<br>
      <b>Flowers were not required to be useful to be appreciated. Luke
(12:27)
said: <i>"Think how the flowers grow; they never have to spin or
weave..."</i>
Some flowers were enjoyed for the pleasure alone which they provided.
In
a flowery mead, it will be recalled, we would encounter mown grass in
which
were periwinkles, daisies, primroses, violets, gillyflowers, or
whatever
else gave colour and fragrance.</b> <br>
      <b><br>
Ornamental gardening was flourishing in England by the late eleventh
century, and may well have been of earlier origin. The general story of
a pleasure garden began, apparently, with high ecclesiastics who
arrived
from Normandy in the reign of William the Conqueror. The story of
English
royal gardens and parks begins with the Conqueror's son, Henry I
(reigned
1100-35). Henry I had a pleasure garden laid out to complement the
castle
his father had built to control the Thames Valley at Windsor, and there
were other pleasure gardens established as well, although no details
about
these royal pleasances have survived. Later kings continued the
practice.
Henry III (reigned 1216-1272) devoted considerable resources to the
building
of pleasure gardens at the Palace of Clarendon, his manors of Guildford
(Surrey) and Kempton (Middlesex), Winchester Castle, Gloucester Castle,
Nottingham Castle, and others. Henry III's patronage of things
beautiful
extended far beyond his rebuilding of Westminster Abbey. When kings
like
Henry III led the way in the creation and development of pleasure
gardens,
the powerful and wealthy figures of the secular and ecclesiastical
aristocracy
followed. There exists, for instance, an account from this era of the
garden
at Holbern belonging to the Earl of Lincoln.</b><br>
      <br>
      <b><u>ROSES AND LILIES<br>
      </u></b>&nbsp;<br>
      <b>An old tradition states that the Romans named the most
north-western
target of their imperialism Albion because of the white roses found
growing
in Britannia, but it is not in fact certain whether the <i>Rosa alba</i>
was present when the Romans arrived or if they imported it. In any
case,
throughout the Medieval period the white rose was available as an
English
garden favourite. Eleanor of Provence, who became the wife of Henry III
in 1236, used a white rose as her emblem, and her son Edward I (reigned
1272-1307) took as an emblem a rose with almost gold-coloured petals
and
a green stem. Edmund, Earl of Lancaster (died 1296), a younger son of
Eleanor
and Henry, adopted a red rose, the <i>Rosa gallica</i>, following his
marriage
to Blanche of Artois (died 1302), granddaughter of Louis VIII of
France,
whose emblem it was; and thus the red rose became the emblem of the
house
of Lancaster. Red roses, like white, were to be found in England
throughout
the Medieval period, and were no new introduction at the time of the
marriage
of of Blanche of Artois and Edmund "Crouchback" in 1275. Richard, Duke
of York (died 1460), used the white rose as a favourite badge, and it
was
taken up by his favorite son Edward IV (reigned 1461-83). The red rose
was evidently not used as a badge by the Lancastrian king, Henry VI
(reigned
1422-61), who was supplanted by his kinsman Edward IV. The catchy title
"Wars of the Roses," for the intermittent civil and dynastic conflict
of
the 1450's to the 1480's between the red rose of Lancaster and the
white
rose of York, was not invented until the eighteenth century, but the
idea
went back at least to the <i>"Crowland Chronicle,"</i> which was
completed
in the 1480's, and the two roses as symbols of the rival dynasties was
given a wider audience in the Temple Garden scene in Shakespeare's <i>Henry
VI, Part I,</i> Act II, scene iv. The first Tudor king, Henry VII
(reigned
1485-1509), employed the propaganda symbol of a combined red and white
rose to represent himself as unifier of the warring factions of
Lancaster
and York. The Tudor rose remains a very familiar symbolic flower.</b> <br>
      <b><br>
The third rose generally cultivated in late medieval England, along
with the red and white, was the damask rose. It will probably never be
known if the pink rose of Damascus was brought to England by merchants,
monks, pilgrims, or crusaders. Along with cultivated roses mention must
be made of the native wild rose, the <i>Rosa rubiginosa</i>, known
also
as the sweet briar or eglantine, which has a lovely smell, is a good
climber
for walls and fences, and was used in the making of mead and various
medicines.
Actually, Medieval cultivated roses would look fairly wild to the
modern
eye, accustomed as it is to the products of scientific breeders. The
flowers
of Medieval cultivated roses were smaller, more open, and more fragile
than today's roses, and they were more delicate of fragrance. The
Medieval
rose plants were more like rambling bushes than modern roses, and the
thorns
were longer and more plentiful, an even more noticeable presence. It
was
when the rose petals were dried and powdered that they had the most
powerful
fragrance, and it was usually the petals of the red rose that were used
in the making of rose water, rose oil, rose preserves, petal garnishes,
and rose sugar. It was the custom to employ roses as symbols of the
Holy
Spirit, and to scatter them in churches for this reason. The practice
was
associated with festivals when roses would have been in bloom, such as
that of John the Baptist (24 June), St. Peter (29 June), and the
moveable
feasts of Whitsun and Corpus Christi (which fell in May or June).</b> <br>
      <b><br>
The lily ranked with the rose as a special flower, and to the Medieval
mind roses and lilies were the devotional flowers without rival. The
lily
was associated with the Virgin Mary. The Venerable Bede (died 735), the
glory of Northumbrian monastic culture, knew the Madonna lily as an
emblem
of the Virgin Mary, the white petals representing her bodily purity and
the golden anthers the light of her soul. The lily was an ancient
fertility
symbol, and it suited the Mother of God. An association of the Virgin
Mary
with <i>The Song of Songs</i> also suggested itself to many Medieval
minds: <i>"I
am the Rose of Sharon, the lily of the valleys."</i> The Biblical Rose
of Sharon may have been the crocus or the narcissus, and the lily of
the
valleys could have been the Palestine anemone, but that is of no
importance
for Medieval symbolism. The lily represented purity, innocent beauty,
and
chastity, a neat parallel for the virgin birth of Christ. It is worth
recalling
as well, that the central image of <i>The Song of Songs</i> is that of
a garden. This means that the example of sensual literature most widely
known to Medieval people was centered upon a garden.<br>
