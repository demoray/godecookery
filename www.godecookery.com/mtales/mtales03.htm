      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Visions of angels, of dead
saints, of departing souls, and of the
Other World were numerous in the Middle Ages. Angels mande revelations
to saints, talked with them, aided them in danger; they were seen by
them
in conflict with demons. People saw one or many angels standing by holy
men at their devotions. The Venerable Bede says of St. Cuthbert that he
was often allowed to see and converse with angels, and when hungry was
refreshed by food prepared by the Lord. St. Columbia was said to have
received
many <i>"sweet angel visits,"</i> when sleepless or in solitude.</b><b><font

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Visions of the soul leaving
the body - as a dove, for example -
or of the soul being carried to Paradise by angels were very common. On
the death of St. Martin, chanting voices were heard in the air, those
of
angels carrying his soul to Paradise. Similarly, demons were often seen
carrying off souls of the departed to Hell.<br>
      <br>
Angels were believed to carry the soul to Paradise, or demons to
transport it to punishment, or angels and demons to dispute for it,
according to its state - ideas borrowed from Judaism. Hence there are
many stories of angels or demons seen by the dying or their watchers,
or of appearances of the Saviour, the Virgin, saints, and martyrs to
them. Pope Gregory cites many of these, and says that when the vision
is that of angels or the blessed the room is filled with light and
sweet fragrance, and the music of Heaven is heard. When sinners die the
visions are terrifying. Demons, as black men, crows, or vultures, with
cruel faces and breathing fire, crowd round and insult the dying. Or a
dragon twines itself round the body, with mouth thrust into mouth to
draw out the breath. A lad who had refused to be a monk was thus
attacked. The monks bade him make the sign of the Cross, but he could
not. Then they prayed for him and the dragon fled. The lad lived to be
an exemplary monk. Severus, a priest, was sent for by a dying man to
intercede for him. He was pruning his vines and said that he would come
presently. Before he arrived the man died. Soon after he returned to
life, and said that cruel men, breathing fire, met him and led him
through dark places, when a beautiful youth, with others like him, came
and carried him back, for Severus was lamenting his death, and, for his
tears, the Lord had granted him longer life. He now did penance and
died cheerfully eight days later. With such edifying stories as these
were medieval folk bidden to prepare for death.<br>

      <p><b><font size="-1">Angels carrying the soul of St. Bertin to
heaven.<br>
From an altarpiece by Simon Marmion, 1480.</font></b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span></p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
early Christian art and literature the soul was represented as a
worshipper, or as a virgin in bright robes, sometimes seen as leaving
the body of&nbsp; a martyr. From early times it was also seen as a
winged Psyche, a pygmy, or a little naked child, as in classical art.
Angels were also depicted carrying such tiny figures in a veil or
shroud to Paradise, or Abraham holds them in his bosom and within his
robe. In the West, from the twelfth century and in earlier loves of
saints, angels carry souls to Heaven, though it is not said that they
are pygmies. Such tiny figures were represented as leaving the body of
the dying by the mouth - an idea of escape known also in ancient times
- and taken by demons or angels. But, according to Irenaeus and
Augustine, souls have the same form as the body - so that may be known,
adds Irenaeus. The soul tormented in the material flames of Purgatory
or Hell must have been believed to have some corporeal qualities. This
was, indeed, a general opinion, and even in Dante's poem incorporeal
souls have taken the form of bodies and are subject to pain.</span><br>

            <td style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: middle;"><b>While
the stories and art of the medieval period generally represent
the soul in some of these forms, there are occasional descriptions of a
different kind. Caesarius of Heisterbach, who depicts the soul as
having bodily form, or as a beautiful boy, gives other accounts of it
in his book. Thus he says that the soul was declared by Master Rudolph
of Cologne to be like a spherical glass vessel, with eyes before and
behind. He also speaks of a female visionary who declared the soul
freed from the body to be a spiritual substance, spherical, in likeness
to a lunar globe, adding that it could see in every part. Nevertheless,
when an angel or a soul appears to men it has corporeal lineaments. A
distinction is thus drawn between visionary and actual appearances.
Roger of Wendover (d. 1236) also reports a vision, seen by Ailric, who
dwelt with St. Godric near Carlisle. At Ailric's death Godric saw his
soul as a kind of spherical body like a hot and burning wind, which
shone like most transparent glass in the midst of an incomparable
whiteness.</b></td>
