Vanity sometimes caused women to be late for Mass; like the lady of
Eynsham described by a fourteenth-century preacher, "who took so long
over adornment of her hair that she barely arrived at church before the
end of Mass." One day the devil in the form of a giant spider descended
on her coiffure. Nothing would dislodge it, neither prayer, exorcism,
nor holy water, until it was confronted with the Eucharist. The spider
then decamped, and presumably the lady thenceforth arrived at church on
time.<br>

and the coquette.<br>
From Geoffrey de Latour Landry's </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Ritter

Furter, Basle, 1493.</span></small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">One
story that must have had a particular appeal to peasant women began, "I
find in the chronicles that there was once a worthy woman who had hated
a poor woman for more than seven years." When the "worthy woman" went
to church on Easter Day, the priest refused to give her communion
unless she forgave her enemy. The woman reluctantly gave lip service to
the act of forgiveness, "for the shame of the world more than for the
awe of God," and so that she could have her communion.<br>
      <br>
      </span>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Then, when service was done... the
neighbors came unto this worthy woman's house with presents to cheer
her, and thanked God highly that they were accorded. But then this
wretched woman said, "Do you think I forgave this woman her trespass
with my heart as I did with my mouth? Nay! Then I pray God that I never
take up this rush at my foot." Then she stooped down to take it up, and
the devil strangled her even there. Wherefore ye that make any
love-days [peace agreements] look that they be made without any
feigning, and let the heart and the tongue accord in them.</span><br>
      </div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br>
      </span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">The priest might
compare
the agony of a sinner in hell with being rolled a mile in a barrel
lined with red-hot nails. Devils were favorite descriptive subjects,
with their faces "burned and black." One devil was so horrible that "a
man would not for all the world look on him once." Hell rang with the
"horrible roaring of devils, and weeping, and gnashing of teeth, and
wailing of damned men, crying, 'Woe, woe, woe, how great is this
darkness!' " If one of them longed for sweetmeats and drink, he got "no
sweetness, nor delicacy, but fire and brimstone... If one of them would
give a thousand pounds for one drop of water, he gets none... There
shall be flies that bite their flesh, and their clothing shall be
worms... and in short, there are all manners of torments in all the
five senses, and above all there is the pain of damnation: pain of
privation of the bliss of heaven, which is a pain of all pains... Think
on these pains; and I trust to God that they shall steer thee to
renounce thy drunken living!"<br>
