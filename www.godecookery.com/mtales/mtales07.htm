Cats were not such common pets as dogs were in the Middle Ages, and
it seems they were viewed in more practical terms as mousers and
ratters.
There is a drawing in the Luttrell Psalter of a tabby toying with a
mouse,
and there is also a carving of a cat with a rat in its mouth, by a
craftsman
who appreciated everyday scenes, on the 15th-century timber watching
gallery
beside the shrine of St. Alban in St. Alban's Abbey (now the
cathedral).
On a further practical note, William Langland wrote in <i>Piers Plowman</i>
of a pedlar who was disposed to kill cats for their skins if he could
manage
to catch them. Archaeologists have found cat bones with cut marks
suggesting
that the fur had been removed. Such a use of the animal signifies the
keeping
of cats as livestock, not pets. Eleanor de Montfort, Countess of
Leicester
and sister of Henry III, appreciated cats, although whether for
practical
or affectionate reasons is not clear, for in 1265 one was purchased for
her household on arrival at Oldham and another was purchased when the
household
moved to Dover.</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      </span><b>Bartholomew de Glanville, who is better known as
Bartholomew
the Englishman, completed a widely used encyclopaedia in about 1240. In
this he wrote some observant lines about cats, which were translated
from
Latin into English late in the 14th-century by John Trevisa:<br>
      <br>
      </b>
      <div style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: left;"><b><i>"...

is whyte, some reed, and som black, som scowed (piebald or calico) and
spenked in the feet and in the eeren... And hath a gret mough and sawe
teeth and scharpe and longe tonge and pliaunt, thynne, and sotile. And
lapeth therwith whanne he drynketh... And he is a ful leccherous beste
in youthe, swyfte, plyaunt, and mery. And lepeth and reseth (rusheth)

some red, and some black, some calico and speckled in the feet and in

And he is a full lecherous in youth, swift, pliant and merry, and
leapeth

playeth therewith; and is a right heavy beast in age and full sleepy,

time of love is hard fighting for wives, and one scratcheth and rendeth
the other grieviously with biting and with claws. And he maketh a
ruthful
noise and ghastful, when one proffereth to fight with one another, and
unneth is hurt when he is thrown from a high place. And when he hath a
fair skin, he is as it were proud thereof, and goeth fast about. And
when
his skin is burnt, then he bideth at home. And is oft for his fair skin
taken of the skinner, and slain and flayed."</b><br>

      <br>
      <b>The words of the Franciscan friar Bartholomew
reach with clarity
from the 13th-century to any observer of cats today, and urge us to
believe
that some Medievals took pleasure in cats as pets. We must note,
however,
that Batholomew concluded his remarks on cats by saying that the animal
      <i>"is
ofte for his fayre skynne ytake of the skynnere and yslayne."</i></b><b><br>
      <br>
Notice is due here of the succession of official cats of Exeter
Cathedral.
The obit accounts for the cathedral from 1305 through 1467 contain the
entry <i>custoribus et cato</i> (to the "custors" - keepers - and the
cat),
and on one occasion <i>pro cato</i> (for the cat), amounting to a
penny
per week. This sum was apparantly to supplement the diet of the
official
cat, who was expected to control the pest population of the cathedral.
A cat-hole is still to be found in the door in the north transept wall
beneath the clock, through which the salaried feline could enter and
egress
while going about its task of hunting rats, mice, birds, and other
threats
to the cathedral. One wonders if John Catterick during his brief tenure
in 1419 as Bishop of Exeter was ever informed by someone with a
whimsical
sense of humour of the existence of the official cat.</b><b><i><u><font

during witch hunts, which fostered or encouraged
all kinds of superstition and brutality. Yet manuscripts show them
about
the house, playing with the spinster's twirling bobbin, and earning

      <br>
      </span><b>There was a certain monastic cat who played with
serpents. The
monks came out in spots, and accused the cat of conveying the serpent's
poison. Fortunately (for the cat) it was pointed out that the serpent
only
played with the cat - so that any poison was delivered accidentally: as
there was no "malice intent," harm would not be transmitted.</b><b><br>
      <br>
However, it was advisable in the dairy to "set trap for a mouse,"
for though a dog is reasonably honest, and properly ashamed if caught,
any cat who will not steal must be mentally deficient - it's the first
thing their mother's teach them!</b><b><i><u><font size="-1"><br>
