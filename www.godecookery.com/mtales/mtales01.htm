      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Abbot Odo, the great 10th
century clerical reformer, received some
of his greatest opposition from the monastery in Fleury, France, where
the monks fervidly resisted his attempts at social, political, and
moral
change within their order. When the Abbot, attended by two bishops,
arrived
at the monastery, an eyewitness was there to record the scene. The
monks,
forewarned of Odo's coming, barricaded the entrance. Then, arming
themselves
with swords and shields they went on to the roof of the building <i>"as
though to hurl stones and missles at their enemy."</i> Others, guarding
the door, said they would rather die than admit the abbot from another
monastery. Later they sent a deputation to show Odo their charters of
independence.
For three days the resistance continued; they even threatened to kill
Odo.
At last, unknown to anyone, the abbot mounted a donkey. On this humble
steed, unattended and unarmed, he approached Fleury. Straightway the
recalcitrant
monks <i>"throwing away their arms went out to meet him and embraced
his feet."</i> In such a fashion were these symbol-conscious monks
of the Middle Ages won over to obedience by Odo's humility.</b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      <br>
      </span><b>On another occasion the signs, hissings and facial
contortions -
which were used in lieu of speech when it was necessary to break the
rule
of silence - became a stumbling block to Odo and his reforming monks.
One
of Odo's party, a monk called Adolfus, was washing his shoes,
preparatory
to the rite of the washing of feet that was about to take place
according
to St. Benedict's Rule. One of the "unreformed" brethren passed
by and saw him. <i>"Tell me where St. Benedict orders monks to wash
their shoes?"</i> he asked Adolfus angrily. The brother made a sign
for him to be quiet, as the monk was breaking the rule of silence. At
that
the monk even more angrily said, <i>"Who are you that come to preach
the Rule to your betters?&nbsp;You pounce like a hawk on our property,
and refuse to talk. God did not make me a serpent to hiss as you do,
nor
an ox that I should bellow. No. He made me a man with a tongue in my
head
- to talk with."</i> While he kept on barking out remarks like this,
Adolfus hurridly retired.</b><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span

Monks retired early, although their rest was not always sufficient,
as the stories of the perpetually tired monk illustrate. To sleep
outside
of designated hours was considered a serious offense. The Cluniacs
introduced
a custom according to which a lantern was placed in front of a sleeping
monk, which he then had to carry with him until he found another monk
who
had dozed off. Naturally, falling asleep during choral prayers was
especially
reprehensible. Caesarius of Heisterbach tells of a monk who fell asleep
so frequently during choral prayers - "a most horrible occurrence"
- that Christ himself finally descended from the cross and gave him
such
a slap on the ear that he died within three days. At night the monks
slept
in their own beds in communal dormitories, in full attire in accordance
with the Rule of St. Benedictine; one monk probably was in charge of
making
certain that his brethren really slept.</b><span
