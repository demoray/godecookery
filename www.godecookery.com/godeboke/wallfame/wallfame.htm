Boke of Gode Cookery. This is a beautiful Medieval cooking site full of
illustrations, attractive text, and interesting recipes. Nearly all the
recipes have the original text, a translation, and an adaptation to
modern cooking ingredients and techniques. The recipes are organized in
food categories (i.e., beverages, meats, poultry, etc.). Check out the
rest of the site, too; there is a Medieval/Renaissance image gallery,
more recipes (not quite as authentic), a section of stories from the
middle ages, and more.<br>

pleasant interlude in between New Year and Mardi Gras! This year, with
the help of a fascinating website, the theme was a medieval twelfth

      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>By Hayley L. Bykens</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Jousting, knights, sword
fights and damsels in distress went by the
way of the Middle Ages. Or did they?&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A devoted group of people from
the Washington-Greene county area
have embraced this period of history so passionately that they have
brought
this time period back to life through their involvement in an
international
organization called Society for Creative Anachronism.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"We're a nonprofit educational
organization dedicated to researching
and recreating the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period," said Scott
Thompson of Scenery Hill, also known as Donnchadh Dubh Ghlas, Seneschal
of the Incipient Kings Crossing.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCA evolved in 1966 in the
state of California, where a group of
science fiction and fantasy fans attempted to create a theme party with
medieval recreation and re-enactment. The group slowly expanded and
evolved
into a game that now has more than 24,000 playing members in the U.S.,
Canada, United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, Germany, Italy, Greece and
Japan,
among others.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"When I was in high school, I
became interested in costumes, and
in college I was shown an article about the SCA and the Pennsic War (an
annual festival for SCA members at Coopers Lake near Butler)," said Jim
Matterer of Mt. Morris. "In March of 1979 I found an SCA group in
Morgantown,
W.Va., and I started to learn different trades, like cooking."&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Members study individuals or
the specific skills the people of the
Middle Ages used. Some people choose to study fencing and fighting,
while
others choose crafts or making period clothing.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Locally, the shire (a group
that has at least five paid members)
from Washington and Greene counties functions under the name of Kings
Crossing,
which comes from the intersecting of two interstate highways that most
of the kings will travel to the Pennsic Wars.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Letters were sent to see if
there was enough interest among several
smaller groups around the area. After about two years, Kings Crossing
took
form and became an official group recognized as the Incipient Shire of
Kings Crossing as of July 2002.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>For SCA members, Pennsic War
is their largest event of the year.
The festival is a two-week event for members to display and sell their
crafts, fight in the Pennsic War and meet people from around the
country
and the world with similar interests in the culture.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Pennsic War is a huge
festival that is not open to the public,"
said Matterer. "We go to the festival for our own enjoyment, and we
share
our interest with others."&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Although the Pennsic War
serves as a festival, an actual battle takes
place between the Middle Kingdom and the East Kingdom. Each side will
have
about 1,000 "warriors." Fighters are "killed" through an honor system.
A decent blow to the body and the head and torso being an automatic
kill.
If the blow felt like it would penetrate and arm or leg, the fighter
would
lose use of that limb.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Heavy weapon fighting is a
full-contact martial art," Thompson said.
"As with all sports, injuries can and sometimes do happen. The SCA has
an extensive armor standard list that every fighter must meet," he
said.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Each fighter is inspected
before fighting begins. Also, each fighter
must learn the rules of the List, which are governed by the ideals of
chivalry
and honor. "This also helps increase the safety on the field," Thompson
said.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Armor can be one of this
hobby's more expensive costs. Prices range
from $200 to more than $2,000, depending on how well protected one
chooses
to be.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Heavy weapons are constructed
from rattan, a fibrous vine wrapped
in duct tape and strapping tape for safety and then used as
swords.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCA provides an active
learning environment. Rather than drill members
with a lot of information, the group allows members to choose and
research
a specific area that interests them.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>While the SCA recreates the
Middle Ages, a few modern conveniences,
such as indoor plumbing, are not far from the battle. One thing the SCA
has not recreated are the plagues of the Middle Ages.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>SCA membership is $35 per year
for the first family member and $10
for each additional member. Also, no one is required to participate in
any event or practice, but it is required if one wishes to be a king or
queen.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Kings Crossing can be found
practicing battles at Washington Mall.
Fencing practice is held from 6 to 9 p.m. Thursdays, and heavy weapon
practice
is held at the same time and place Fridays.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"We armor up and then start at
it," said Thompson. "We start at half
speed to warm up and then run single bouts in a 'Bear Pit' style in
which
the winner holds the field and the loser steps out and is replaced by
the
next fighter. This will continue until everyone is tired and decides to
take a break."&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Kings Crossing welcomes
people to join them during practice and experience
the excitement firsthand.</b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Appetites haven't changed much
in past millennium</b> <br>
      <b>By Lance Gay</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>How did our ancestors eat in
the days before there were supermarkets,
fast food restaurants, refrigerators or temperature-controlled stoves
and
ovens? And what did the dinner table look like before the discovery of
the New World brought back to Europe staple foods ranging from turkey
to
tomatoes and the humble potato?</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Victorian view was that
medieval food was a disgusting slop of
thin gruels and roast meat. Hollywood added its own touches of festive
diners
throwing bones to dogs in the dining room, or wiping their greasy hands
on the dog's fur.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>But recent historical and
archeological research is providing a much
different and richer picture, concluding that much of the food served
on
the medieval dinner table would be recognized and enjoyed today, and
pointing
out that even medieval etiquette frowned on unsanitary dogs at the
dinner
table.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"I think it would be very
recognizable to one today, with the same
tastes," said Bridget Ann Henisch, a medieval scholar and author of
several
books on medieval cooking. "It was more adventurous. Even the keenest
foodie
would not be so adventurous today."</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The medieval diet seems also
to have been far more varied than the
goods that can be found in a modern supermarket.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Among things eaten were
starlings, vultures, gulls, herons, talks,
cormorants, swans, cranes, peacocks, capons, chickens, dogfish,
porpoises,
seals, whale, haddock, hedgehogs, cod, salmon, sardines, lamprey eels,
crayfish and oysters. Turnips, parsnips, carrots, peas and fava beans
were
common vegetables, and use of onions and garlic was common. Whatever
the
meal, it was well spiced. The Roman conquest brought nutmeg and cloves
to Northern Europe, and cinnamon was used before that.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There is ample evidence many
ate well.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Inventories prepared for the
6,000 guests invited to the daylong
1467 installation ceremonies of Archbishop Neville of York in England,
show they were provided with 300 caskets of ale, 100 caskets of wine, 1
large bottle of wine sweetened with sugar, nutmeg and ginger, 104 oxen,
6 wild bulls, 1,000 sheep, 304 calves, 400 swans, 2,000 geese, 1,000
capons,
2,000 pigs, 104 peacocks, over 13,500 other birds, 500 stags, bucks and
roes, 1,500 venison pies, 608 pikes and breams, 12 porpoises and seals,
13,000 dishes of jelly, cold baked tarts, custards and spices, sugared
delicacies and wafers.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>At the other end of the social
spectrum, peasants survived on broths
thickened with barley or other grains, and oatcakes cooked in the ashes
of fires or on heated stones. It was common throughout Europe to leave
a stockpot on the fire embers during the day into which greens or other
foods foraged were added, and then thickened before eating.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"There may be some tiny meat,"
Henisch said.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Vickie Ziegler, director of
the Center for Medieval Studies at Penn
State University, said that during periods of plenty, everyone from
lord
to peasant seems to have eaten well. But periods of famine that
accompanied
changes in the weather known as the "Little Ice Age" beginning in the
13th
century were particularly harsh for those tied to the land and without
money to buy food.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ziegler's center operates a
medieval garden at the State College,
Pa., campus to demonstrate what sort of plants and herbal medicines
might
be grown in backyards of the time. Most of the plants are familiar
today,
including carrots, beets and cabbages, but medieval tastes favored some
vegetables that have gone out of favor in modern kitchens like sorrel
and
leeks.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Meals could be very
complicated. In an instruction book for his 15-year-old
bride, an elderly Parisian in the 1390s indicates that meals of 24 to
30
dishes were not uncommon. In the expectation he would die before his
wife,
he left detailed accounts of how she should run the household, with
recipes
for common dishes.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Some, like his recipe for
Cinnamon Soup, are surprisingly spicy:
"Cut up your poultry or other meat, then cook in water and add wine,
and
fry. Then take raw almonds with the skin on unpeeled, and a great
quantity
of cinnamon, and grind up well, and mix with your stock or with beef
stock,
and put to boil with your meat: then grind ginger, clove and grain,
etc.,
and let it be thick and yellow-brown."</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Other 15th century recipes are
for tarts or quiches. "Parboil onions,
and sage, and parsley, and cut them small, then take good fat cheese,
and
grind it, and add eggs, and temper it up with them, and add butter and
sugar, and currants, and powdered ginger, and cinnamon, mix all this
well
together, and put it in a crust, and bake it uncovered, and serve it
forth,"
the recipe says.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>But the rich sauces of French
cooking are a 19th century invention,
as is spaghetti. In the Middle Ages, Italians relied on polenta.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Jim Matterer, a Pennsylvania
cook who started the medieval food Web
site <a href="http://www.godecookery.com/">www.godecookery.com</a>
while
recovering from a back injury, said spices weren't used to disguise
rotten
food, but to improve flavor.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"They had the same instincts
as we have now about rotten meat," he
said. "Mankind then and now knew what tasted good."</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Matterer, who has turned his
interest in medieval cooking into a
business that caters medieval and renaissance fairs, said there are
records
showing it wasn't all home cooking in medieval times.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>"Cook shops were prevalent in
cities. People didn't want to cook
in their houses because it was dangerous," he said. He noted the
British
poet Chaucer refers in Reeve's Tale to the daughter of the reeve being
sent off to buy a loaf of bread and a goose when a visitor dropped by
the
house.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>He said there also was
considerable trade in food, with evidence
of ships bringing goods from the Mediterranean to Northern Europe and
Russia.
A recent archeological dig concluded that bananas were available in
16th
century London.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Diet was dependent on seasonal
influences, and the winter months
were times of scarcity. Wild animals were hard to find in winter, and
preparations
were made in October and November for winter months. Pigs were cured in
the chimneys and beef was salted down for winter.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There also were religious
influences. Church ordinances decreed that
no meat should be eaten on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, or during
Lent. These became "fish days" and historians say the diet was kept
strictly
with dried or salted fish sold in inland markets, or in some cases
transported
live in barrels of water.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Medical influences also
prevailed. By the 11th century, a medical
school in Salerno, Italy, devised diets that could adjust the tempers
of
man. Hot-tempered men, for example, were to skip spicy foods like
onion,
but the lethargic were to add more. Onion also was regarded as an
ingredient
crucial for averting baldness.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>To eat the food, there were
spoons and knives. Two-pronged forks
appear in Venice in the 11th century, apparently brought back from the
Middle East, and the first etiquette books detailing how to act
properly
at the table appear a century later, since bowls were shared around the
table between two people.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Among the 13th century table
manners, one book tells diners not to
pick their teeth with their knives, and to "refrain from falling upon
the
dish like a swine while eating, snorting disgustingly and smacking the
lips."</b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Posted by Teresa Nielsen Hayden</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>I've messed around some with
medieval recipes over the years, enough
so that I regard "tyl it be y-now" as a normal cooking instruction, and
I'd gotten to thinking I pretty much knew the basic corpus of surviving
medieval recipes. I'm delighted to report that I was not only wrong,
but
that the material that gives me the lie is extravagantly and gloriously
weird. It's collected together on the Incredible Foods, Sotelties, and
Entremets page.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>They've got all the classic
medieval solteties and bizarreries I
expected to find when I went to check out the page: cooked peacock
re-clothed
in its skin and feathers, check; fruited meatloaf made to look like a
giant
peasecod, check; roasted chicken dressed in helmet, shield, and lance,
riding on a roasted pig, check; three recipes for cockatrice, check
check
check.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>But making the re-feathered
peacock breathe fire--now, that's a new
one on me. So's a clever (if hazardous) use of unslaked lime to power
fireless
cooking.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There are directions--unkind,
but it must have been very funny if
the gag came off--for treating a live plucked chicken so it looks and
acts
like it's been roasted, until such time as it wakes up and takes off
across
the dinner table. I don't know, maybe it'll run past the fire-breathing
peacock that's cooked but looks like it's alive. That'd be weird. It
would
be even better if you served both of them at the same time as the roast
chicken that sings. That would give you one edible bird out of three,
since
the live chicken can't be eaten, and the method for making the roast
chicken
sing involves stuffing the neck cavity with sulphur and
quicksilver.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>But for my money, the real
showstopper is the recipe for decorating
a perfectly good roast "That flesh may look bloody and full of worms,
and
so be rejected by smell-feasts"--a smell-feast being a <i>schnorrer</i>,
someone who always shows up at dinnertime looking hopeful. This jolly
trick,
it turns out, is from How to drive Parasites and Flatterers from great
men's tables, the thirteenth chapter of Giambattista della Porta's <i>Magia
naturalis</i>:</b>&nbsp; </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">
      <blockquote><b>How to make good meat appear rotten:&nbsp;</b>
        <p><b>Boil Hares blood, and dry it, and powder it. Cast the
powder upon
the meats that are boiled, which will melt by the heat and moisture of
the meat, that they will seem all bloody, and he will loath and refuse
them. Any man may eat them without any rising of his stomach. If you
cut
Harp strings small, and strew them on hot flesh, the heat will twist
them,
and they will move like Worms.</b><br>
        </p>
      </blockquote>

just about right for that period; medieval

you&#8217;d just like to chuck modern life and
beam yourself back to a more peaceable time, spend an hour or two at
www.godecookery.com,
the Web site for all "gode thyngs" Medieval. You can get lost here,
wandering
the site just as Chaucer&#8217;s pilgrims meandered toward Canterbury. The
site
is vast, encompassing contributions from members of the Society for
Creative
Anachronism, from academic Medievalists, and from others who simply
love
to study Medieval life in minute detail.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Especially the food &#8212;
presented both in archaic language and interpreted
for the modern kitchen. For instance, all of the food mentioned in
Chaucer&#8217;s <i>Canterbury
Tales</i> is described, from "ale" to "ypocras" (the author is working
on Z). Even though Chaucer himself used food in his writing mostly as
props
for the characters, we can get a good idea of the "feeste and cheere"
enjoyed
by society of the time.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>A festive Medieval meal
usually started with foods considered easily
digestible (light meats, soups and broths, moist fruits such as
peaches,
and greens and herbs. Spices were believed to warm the stomach and
"open
it" to other foods. Cheese, recommended by physicians for good
digestion,
was often eaten before, during, and after a meal.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Heavy foods (dark meats,
"dense" fruits like pears and chestnuts)
and fancy or exotic items) came later, served in small portions. Fish
was
usually paired with nuts, also thought to aid digestion. Wines and ales
were served throughout, and sweets were saved for last, often made with
spices such as ginger (again, for digestion). The courses were often
separated
by intervals of conversation, music, and entertainment.&nbsp;</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>If you&#8217;d like your own
holiday meals to resonate with Medieval touches,
godecookery.com will give you lots of good ideas. You may even decide
to
make your own ypocras.</b></div>
      <center>
      <p><b>Ypocras</b></p>
      </center>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Ypocras, also called Hippocras
(after the famous Greek physician
Hippocrates), was a popular Medieval beverage. A sweetened, spiced
wine,
it was made by combining "ypocras powder" (a blend of spices) with
sugar
and/or honey in wine. Here is the modernized recipe, found in
"Chaucer&#8217;s
foods" at godecookery.com.</b> </p>
      <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li> <b>1 bottle (750 mL) of sweet red or white wine</b></li>
        <li> <b>1 to 2 cups honey, or 1-1/2 cups sugar, or a
combination</b></li>
        <li> <b>1 tablespoon each ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, white
pepper, ground cloves,
ground nutmeg, and caraway seed</b></li>
        <li> <b>cheesecloth for straining</b></li>
      </ul>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Bring the wine and honey or
sugar to a boil; if using honey, skim off
the scum that arises. Taste for sweetness. Remove from heat, stir in
spices,
and allow to sit, covered, for 24 hours. The spices will form a thick
residue
on the bottom. Using a ladle, transfer the wine to another container,
straining
it through 2 or 3 layers of cheesecloth to remove pieces of spice. Do
not
disturb the residue at the bottom of the pot. Make at least a month
before
serving. The older it is, the better.</b> </div>

Companion</i>, edited by Tania Bayard,

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, CANADA -
Feeling like spicing up your fall
menus? How about some Pokerounce, Blaunderellys, or a nice Sugared
Capon?
"A Boke of Gode Cookery" shows you how to get Medieval in your kitchen.</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Launched in 1997, the Boke of
Gode Cookery demonstrates through a
collection of authentic period recipes that, in many ways, the Medieval
diet was not that different from our own. (Though some dishes, such as
Puddyng of Purpaysse --Porpoise Pudding-- seem to have lost a bit of
their
popularity.) The design of the site, while attractive, is low-tech,
basic
HTML --translating into quicker downloads and fewer incompatibility
headaches--
and while visitors will encounter occasional broken image links, they
don't
take too much away from the appeal of the site.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>After a few words in favor of
the Medieval diet, the Boke presents
its extensive Table of Contents. The first section, "Recipes and
Cookery,"
includes the "Boke of Gode Cookery Recipes," and other collections
"translated
and adapted for the modern cook." Translation in this case involves
presenting
the recipes both as originally published ("Serge hem florwe a Sefe
in-to
a potte") and in the modern vernacular ("pass it through a strainer
into
a pot"). Selections include everything from the basic Meat Pie and
Gyngerbrede,
to Apple Muse, (apples, almond milk, and honey) Funges (Mushrooms in
broth
and spices) and Makerouns (a dish of noodles and cheese, which in
another
time might have been called Krafte Dinnre). A trio of complete menus,
such
as 14th century instructions for "Servise on a Flesh Day," are also
included.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>(In addition to translations
and metric conversion tables, the Boke
also offers helpful substitution suggestions for those hard-to-find
ingredients.
If, for example, you just can't find a nice fresh porpoise for your
Porpoise
Pudding, the Boke recommends a large salmon, trout, or any other whole
fish. Of course, after reading the entire recipe, you may just decide
to
have a nice peanut butter sandwich instead.)</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Cooks more interested in the
atmospheric than the authentic can peruse
a selection of "Modern Recipes for Beginners," which includes such
dishes
as Honey Cakes and Beef Barley Soup. While not collected from Medieval
sources, the Modern Recipes still have the "flavour" (sorry about that)
of the real thing.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>At the other extreme are the
genuine dishes collected within "Incredible
Foods, Solteties, and Entremets," where things get much more exotic, if
not palatable. In addition to such cliche classics as Boar's Head, and
less familiar but catchy alternatives like the "Trojan Hog," (whole pig
stuffed with small birds and shellfish) Incredible Foods also offers
helpful
serving tips; how to make your dish appear to breathe fire, how to make
a roasted chicken "sing" at the table, and how to discourage
Smell-feasts
(moochers looking for a free meal) by using Harp strings to make your
meat
appear worm-infested.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Closing out the Recipes
section is a "Glossary of Medieval Cooking
Terms," and if you'd like to backtrack to a specific fare, all the
recipes
are accessible through a keyword search engine that recognizes both old
and new English terms.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>After the recipes, interested
visitors can investigate food in its
historical and cultural context, through a collection of "Articles on
Cookery."
Essays include a examination of food as a literary device in The
Canterbury
Tales, "An Elizabethan Dinner Conversation," ("The meat marreth; where
have you tarried so long?") and "Messe it Forth" - the preparation of a
feast according to the Four Humour System (Melancholy, Choler, Phlegm,
and Blood). "Images" offers "A Feast For The Eyes" (a clipart
collection
of more than 270 period images) and "Tacuinum Sanitatis," with text and
images collected from Medieval health handbooks. Other offerings
include
related "Resources" and some information about the Society for Creative
Anachronism (the people who populate the Renaissance Faires).</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Speaking as someone who
doesn't cook anything unless it comes from
a Tinne, a Freezre, or an Easye Open Pouche, I don't expect to make any
practical use of the information contained here, but even for a casual
visitor, the Boke has a definite edutainment value. For the more
adventurous
--and skilled-- these pages represent a genuine opportunity to shake up
the personal diet.</b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Back in the old days of
Europe, the Celts were cooking up a storm
in Ireland. Wouldn't it be nice to recapture some of that
honest-to-goodness
goodness? Well, one might think that using an old recipe (we're talking
ancient), a person would have to know how to read a foreign language!
Well,
fear not, my budding bakers!!!</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>There is a website called "A
Boke of Gode Cookery" (or for modern
people, this would be "A Book of Good Cookery"). Contained within are
hundreds
of medieval recipes. Some require "out-there" ingredients like
rosewater
or elderflowers but if you really want to thrill with your culinary
expertise,
you can find them or order them from the guy who runs the site. If
you're
not interested in going to all that trouble just for a measly cookie,
then
I suggest you check out the recipe for CELTIC SHORTBREAD.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>This recipe contains THREE
INGREDIENTS. Yes, only three! Plus, they
are very easily assembled, and you can even buy the ingredients at your
local grocery store. You might even have them in your cabinet right
now!!</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The recipe calls for:</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>1 cup of butter (softened)</b>
      <br>
      <b>3/4 cups of dark brown sugar (use dark brown or they won't
have
the right taste)</b> <br>
      <b>2 cups of flour</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Preheat the oven to 300&deg;
F. Cream the butter in the bowl of an
electric mixer. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy. Add the
flour,
1/3 cup at a time, until a soft dough is formed. (Do not overbeat!)
Bake
for 25 to 30 minutes, or until rounds are just firm to the touch.&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>This makes about 16 cookies
depending on how big you make them. Be
prepared! They won't be VERY sweet, but they are yummy! My friend
Brittany
and I made them to take to a medieval feast we attended (we made
several
batches), and they were a HIT! We came home with an empty basket and
thousands
of compliments!</b> </p>

abundance of information regarding medieval
food preparation, we are more concerned with the Tacuinum Sanitatus,
under
the Images heading, and Messe it Forth, found under Articles on
Cookery.
The Tacuinums were illuminated medical manuals, and the site examples
are
taken from those of Paris, Rouen, and Vienna. Watermelons and cucumbers
were found to cool fevers and purify the urine; roses could soothe an
inflamed
brain. Messe it Forth (Serve it) deals with the nutritional issues of
the
Middle Ages, when physicans based their views on the four humors. It is
interesting to compare the order in which food was served then and now,
and to note that medieval diners also looked forward to something sweet
at the conclusion of a meal.</b></div>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>James L. Matterer has been
interested in medieval cookery for around
20 years and his site seeks to enthuse the rest of us through
meticulous
research, high academic standards, and a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour.
The graphics and design are brilliant, and the text is fascinating.
Speed
is good, and even the huge image gallery comes up reasonably quickly.
Matterer
makes clear what is authentic and what is not, and the recipes are
printed
as originally published, followed by a translation, then a version of
the
dish written inmodern recipe style. It can be a little confusing,
though,
as there are many overlapping sections and some seem to have more than
one name; for example, the Image Collection is also called A Feast for
the Eyes.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Special Features:</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Modern Recipes for Beginners</u>:
Medieval in style, rather than
strictly authentic (although some recipes are). It's designed as an
easy
introduction to the flavours of the period, so ingredients are readily
available and cooking techniques are simple. Some recipes also come
with
a nutritional analysis.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>A Boke of Gode Cookery
Recipes</u>: Matterer's comprehensive archive
of annotated recipes from the medieval period, complete with literary
and
contemporary cooking translations. Some include rare, strange-sounding
ingredients, others are remarkably like what you ate last time you had
friends over for dinner.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Chaucerian Cookery</u>: An
exploration of food as a literary device
in The Canterbury Tales. A biography, Chaucerian feast menu, and
recipes
complete the study.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>How to Cook Medieval</u>:
Advice on which ingredients are appropriate
for authentic medieval cooking. Actually, it's not hard to figure out,
unless you're American: anything native to the New World was
unavailable
in Europe during the Middle Ages. Consequently, the website's motto is
'No turkey legs'.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Image Collection</u>:
Around 200 authentic images in six galleries
are available for downloading, which is great but, given that there are
so many, a more meaningful categorisation would be useful.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b><u>Links</u>: Hundreds of
sites are listed on related topics - not
just food but medieval and renaissance literature, music, clothes,
castles,
mail-order retailers and so on.</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Other features:</b> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The Newe Boke of Olde Cokery
is written by another scholar, Rudd
Rayfield, and the Historical Cookery Page is a contributory section
including
articles from experts on food in other time periods.</b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>Verily, this site is so well
put-together one could become greatly
interested in medieval cooking.</b></div>

goes straight to his <i>Joy of Cooking</i>. But when he wants
information
on hosting a medieval dinner, he goes to Gode Cookery, his trusty

Web site on Renaissance and medieval cookery. Wells, in fact, has about
a dozen specialty culinary sites bookmarked for quick reference. "It's
a habit for me," says Wells. "Every evening before I head home I try to
remember what is left in the refrigerator that sounds good for dinner.
I jump on SOAR (the Searchable Online Archive of Recipes) and do a
recipe
search for, say, salmon, and come up with a dozen or so recipes. I
select
one. Stop at the store on the way home to get other ingredients and

Good eating didn't waiting until the electric
stove and the 20th century to arrive on the scene. Mouth-watering
feasts
have been around for centuries -- and some far more elaborate than what
we can dream up today, as James L. Matterer's Chaucerian Cookery proves
beyond doubt. The site is, of course, based on "gode cooking" as it was
done in the days of poet Geoffrey Chaucer, he of "The Canterbury
Tales."
You can work up a modern Chaucerian feast of "mete and drynke" for a
dozen
or so guests, and Matterer's site guides you through the intricacies.
To
do it right, start with soup or broth, bread, or moist fruit such as
peaches
-- foods that were considered easily digestible -- followed by a meat
dish
of pork and chicken, or perhaps fish, then on to smaller portions of
rich,
exotic foods. Sweets and desserts wrap up the dinner, and wines and
ales
of all sorts are consumed from start to burping finish. "Divide the
various
dishes among two or three courses, serving each course in its entirety,
and leaving time for talk, music and entertainment for guests between
courses,"
says Matterer. And "make sure to fill your glasses in a toast to Squire
Geoffrey as you enjoy a <i>gentil pasture</i> of good food and
company."</b></div>
