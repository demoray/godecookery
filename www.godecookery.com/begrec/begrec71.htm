      <hr size="1" width="80%"><b><i></i></b>
      <p><b><i>Pye Ellisif</i> is an original recipe that was created
for a Medieval
feast being held by the <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for
Creative
Anachronism, Inc.</a> (the SCA), in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on
November
26, 1991. The person in charge of the event requested a dish for the
feast
called <i>Koken van Honer</i>, a meat &amp; chicken pie recipe from <i>A
Miscellany</i> by <a href="http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/">David Friedman</a>,
which in turn was taken from <i>An Early 13th c. Northern-European
Cookbook</i>
by Rudolf Grewe. The other cooks who were working on the feast instead
wanted to do only a simple chicken pie. <i>Pye Ellisif</i>, then, was
my
compromise between the two requests. Since I did not have Grewe's
original
recipe to consult, I adapted elements of Friedman's version along with
instructions for making <a href="../goderec/grec45.htm">Pyes de Pares</a>,
as found in Two 15th c. Cookery-Books, p. 53, and came up with a pie
that
was easy to prepare but had the taste and flavor of the more
complicated
version.</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>1 1/2 lb. cooked chicken, minced or in small pieces</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>1/2 cup diced cooked American-style bacon OR: 1/2 cup
diced cooked ham</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>3 cups <a href="../goderec/grec15.htm">Gode Broth</a>
(with additional
bread crumbs)</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>1 cup white wine</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>1 9" pie shell (lid optional)</b></li>
        <li>
          <b>1 egg yolk</b></li>
      </ul>
      <b>Make the Gode Broth according to the instructions, reserving
additional
bread crumbs. Keeping the broth over medium heat, add the wine and
thicken
with the extra bread crumbs to the consistency of gravy. Mix with the
chicken
&amp; spices. Mixture should be slightly runny. In the bottom of the
pie
shell, spread out the ham or bacon; pour the chicken mixture on top.
Add
pie shell lid, if using. Bake at 375&deg; F for 30-45 minutes, or until
pastry is golden brown and filling is set. Remove pie from oven, brush
beaten egg yolk over the top of the pie or lid, then return to the oven
for approx. 1 minute, or until glaze has set - be careful not to
overcook,
as the egg yolk will turn brown and the pie will lose its golden shade.</b>
      <p><b>Like David Friedman's recipe, <i>Pye Ellisif</i> is a pie
shell lined
with bacon or ham and filled with chicken meat. In addition, there is
the
use of broth made with wine, as described in <i>Pyes de Pares,</i>
with
its main seasonings being pepper and cumin, the spices featured in <i>A
Miscellany</i>. <i>Pyes de Pares</i> also calls for the pie to have a
lid,
which I have left as an option. <i>A Miscellany</i> calls for saffron
and
egg yolks to be added to the meat mixture to give the entire filling a
golden cast. I instead simply endore the top of the pie (or the lid)
with
egg yolk. <i>Pye Ellisif</i> is named after Monica Cellio, known to
her
SCA friends as Meistari Ellisif Flakkari, the woman who originally
requested
      <i>Koken
van Honer</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>This recipe was submitted in a SCA arts &amp; sciences
competition
at an event called <i>Gathering of the Ladies Confederation</i>, held
in
the Shire of Nithgaard (Central Pennsylvania) on May 9, 1992. <i>Pye
Ellisif</i>
won first place in the Domestic A &amp; S category.</b>
