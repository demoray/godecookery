<p><b><u>What we will do</u>: game hens roasted with a little olive oil,
spices, &amp; herbs, served with the three different dipping sauces: a
savory made with sage, a hot &amp; spicy made with mustard &amp; cinnamon,
&amp; a sweet &amp; sour made with cherries.</b>
<p><b>Servers will be given platters holding small disposable bowls of
the dipping sauces, 3 different sauces for each diner, and will pass these
out accordingly. Servers will then be given platters of roasted chicken
along with the appropriate serving utensils and will serve the diners individually,
1/2 hen per person.</b>
<p><b>The Sauces: (1) Cold Sage. (2) Cameline. (3) Verjuice.</b>
<p><b>(1). Froide sauge. Cook your poultry in water, then set it to cool;
grind ginger, cassia buds, grains of Paradise and cloves, and do not strain
them; then grind bread, parsley and sage, with, if you wish, a little saffron
in this greenery to make it a bright green, and sieve this; and some people
add strained, hard-cooked egg yolks steeped in vinegar; do not boil.</b>

<p><b><u>What we will do</u>: a dipping sauce made from chicken broth,
parlsey, &amp; sage, thickened with bread.</b>
<p><b>(2). Cameline Mustard sauce. Take mustard, red wine, cinnamon powder
and enough sugar, and let everything steep together. It should be thick
like cinnamon. It is good for any roast.</b>

<p><b><u>What we will do</u>: Dijon mustard blended with red grape juice,
cinnamon, &amp; honey.</b>
<p><b>(3). Sauce of Sour Cherries or of Ordinary Cherries. Follow the directions
for the Black Grape Sauce but, since the sour cherries are tart, add in
all the sugar and cinnamon your master may wish.</b>
<p><b>Black Grape Sauce. Get good black grapes, crush them carefully into
a vessel with a crustless loaf of bread, and add in a little verjuice so
the grapes will not be so sweet; boil this, but first strain it; when you
have boiled it, add cinnamon, ginger and other sorts of spices. Note that
this strained sauce should boil half an hour so that it is somewhat thick.</b>

<p><b><u>What we will do</u>: a sweet and sour sauce will be made from
cherries, fruit juice, unseasoned white bread crumbs, sugar, &amp; spices.</b>
<p><b>Note: verjuice is very tart grape juice, or unfermented wine, and
may be substituted with a variety of sour fruit juices. We are using Sour
Cherry Sauce as an alternative to actual verjuice.</b>

<p><b>This is an original recipe, based on cake receipts from <i>A.W.'s
Book of Cookrye</i> (1591) and <i>The English Huswife</i> by Gervase Markham,
1615. These sources are not medieval, but this type of sweet, almost bread-like
round cake was very common during the Middle Ages, and our recipe is an
approximation of how this delectable may have been prepared during that
earlier period. A round cake such as this is described in Chaucer's <i>Canterbury
Tales</i>, where it is compared to the shape of the medieval round shield,
the Buckler.</b>
<p><b><u>What we will do</u>: round, home-made white cakes are baked with
a variety of period seeds &amp; spices.</b>
