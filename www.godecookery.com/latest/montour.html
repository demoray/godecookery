 hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left">When Tammy Crawford wants to get
away from it all, she simply becomes someone else. Her name changes to
Signora Tomasia da Collivento, who was born in Castaglione, Italy in
1393.<br>
      <br>
She becomes a kitchen worker cooking medieval feasts instead of the
secretary at Hebron United Presbyterian Church. </span><br>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Her husband, John, also plays
along, and becomes a medieval archery marshall, and their 5-year-old
daughter, Victoria, turns into a princess. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Instead of living in Clinton,
they reside in the Kingdom of Aethelmearc and are members of the Canton
Stelton Wald. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The transformation all began
about five years ago when Tammy, of Clinton, went looking for a
medieval re-enactment group for her husband, John, who loved dragons
and wizards. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What she found was the Society
of Creative Anachronism (SCA), an international organization dedicated
to researching and re-creating the arts and skills of pre-17th-century
Europe. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The SCA's world consists of 18
kingdoms, with over 30,000 members residing in countries around the
world. Members, dressed in clothing of the Middle Ages and Renaissance,
attend events, which may feature tournaments, arts exhibits, classes,
workshops, dancing, feasts, and more. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Members can get involved in and
learn about many different facets such as archery, fencing,
woodworking, crafts, arts, science, games and other past times from
that period. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Soon after her husband joined,
Tammy became involved in the kitchen work, helping to prepare the
feasts featuring foods from long ago. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">She teamed up with another SCA
member, Jim Matterer of Mt. Morris, Pa., also known as Master Huen in
the medieval world, who has been researching and recreating medieval
food since 1979. He asked Tammy if she would like to be his apprentice,
and she has now been his student for 2 1/2 years. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Last year she began helping him
with his Web site, A Boke of Gode Cookery at www.godecookery.com. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The site consists of a
compilation of medieval recipes from authentic sources adapted for the
21st Century kitchen along with diverse facts on food and feasting in
the Middle Ages and Renaissance and other historical culinary items. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy is the editor of the Gode
Cookery recipe collection. She says she takes lots of pictures of the
food to accompany the recipes on the Web site so that the cooks know
what the dish is suppose to look like. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">She gets her recipes from
research in libraries, on the internet, and through Michigan State
University, which scans old books from libraries and museums and make
them available. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Many times samples of the food
she makes are given out to the public when Tammy and her group do
demonstrations. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy also collects cookbooks
and has done so even before getting involved in SCA. She had more than
200 cookbooks on compilation files from the 1700s or earlier and more
than 500 cookbooks from the 1800s to modern times. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"I grew up in a large family and
there was always something cooking," she says. "I liked to do what my
grandmother did, but during most of the time when I was growing up, my
grandmother was in a wheelchair and I really couldn't learn everything
from her so I decided I would educate myself." </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">One of her medieval favorite
recipes, that she says is addicting, is called chyches, which are
garlic and onion garbonzo beans or chik peas. Although some of the
other recipes call for blood, she laughs and says she doesn't make
those ones. She substitutes red wine for the blood. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Her love for cooking the
medieval foods also lead her to helping Matterer with his medieval
catering business, with the same name as his Web site, Gode Cookery. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">At times, Tammy has cooked
medieval foods for weddings with medieval themes, and Materer sells
medieval cookies all over the world. His catering business also is the
premiere caterer for the Alabama Renaissance Fair, in which the
Crawfords also participate. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">When Tammy is not catering,
helping to develop the Web site or finding a new (or old) cookbook, she
and Matterer are working on a cookbook of their own and occasionally
starring in a television show. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The cookbook of medieval
recipes, titled the Book of Gode Cookery, is expected to be available
by September, and more information can be obtained from the Gode
Cookery Web site. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">And, just a few weeks ago, they
completed the second taping of a television show for the Food Network,
called The Secret Life of Birthday Cakes. Crawford says she and
Matterer made a Roman wine cake, which was the predecessor of the
birthday cake, dating back to the time of Emperor Caesar. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The show will air sometime this
summer. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The first show, which aired last
year, was titled, The Secret Life of Sandwiches, and focused on
trenches bread. Tammy explains that the medieval bread had been used as
a plate, but it was considered in poor taste to eat the plate - it
would mean the diner was a glutton. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">But, eventually it was the
beginning of a sandwich, because people began wrapping up the food
inside the "plate." </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Both shows, hosted by Jim
O'Connor of New York, were taped at the Century Inn, an 18th century
bed and breakfast in Scenery Hill, south of Washington, Pa. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy says she hopes to continue
doing the shows once a year. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">In the meantime, she and her
family and other members of the SCA attend various medieval festivals
such as the Pennsic War re-enactment near Coopers Lake. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">More than 15,000 medieval
re-enactors get together for two weeks in mid August each year and
"pretend they lived 500 years ago," Tammy says with a laugh. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">They also like to attend war
practice for that event in May. The practice, open to the public, is
for those in the Kingdom of Aethelmearc. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy explains that the
"kingdom" encompasses those re-enactors who live within certain
borders. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">She says that the kingdom, which
covers western Pennsylvania, northern West Virginia and southern New
York, includes smaller areas with various medieval names. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Crawfords are members of the
Canton Stelton Wald, which consists of about 40 re-enactors, mostly
from Beaver County. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Since the re-enactors can't wear
blue jeans or polyester to the events, Tammy also learned how to sew
and make hers, her husbands and daughter's clothes from natural fibers.
      </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">John is an archery marshall with
the group and has been working on putting his armor together and
Victoria dresses up as a princess complete with long skirt and puffy
sleeves. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy says her daughter also is
an adventurous eater and likes to try out the medieval foods. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"One of the great things about
doing this is you get to be and create someone completely different,"
she says. "We love to go to events because there are no TVs and cell
phones. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"It's a chance to escape from
everyday normal life. A lot of our virtues are based on the old codes
of conduct, chivalry and honor. Everyone is your friend and part of a
big family." </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Crawfords have pursued their
hobby not only to Alabama and Coopers Lake, but also to York, New York
and Kentucky, and Tammy says her dream is to go to Germany and England
some day. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tammy also has taken her love of
the medieval times beyond her passion for cooking. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">She also has a degree in art and
has learned how to recreate the medieval manuscripts complete with
calligraphy and gold gilding that used to be created by monks before
the invention of the printing press. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Next on the agenda for Tammy is
her own medieval Web site, www.padronadicasa.us. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Web site, is named such, she
says, because she has an Italian persona and it stands for Italian
housewife. </span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Although not quite ready, the
Web site will be a link of the Gode Cookery site. Also, this summer she
is hoping to again make a presentation about medieval cooking at West
Allegheny Community Library.</span></div>
