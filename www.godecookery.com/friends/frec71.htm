<center><b>Eggs stuffed with cheese, raisins, &amp; herbs - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipes from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>Make fresh eggs hard by cooking for a long time. Then, when the shells
are removed, cut the eggs through the middle so that the whole white is
not damaged. When the yolks are removed, pound part with raisins and good
cheese, some fresh, some aged. Reserve part to color the mixture, and also
add a little finely cut parsley, marjoram, and mint. Some put in two or
more egg whites with spices. When the whites of the eggs have been stuffed
with this mixture and closed, fry them over a slow fire in oil. When they
have been fried, add a sauce made from the rest of the egg yolks pounded
with raisins and moistened with verijuice and must. Put in ginger cloves,
and cinnamon and heat them a little while with the eggs themselves. This
has more harm than good in it. (Milham, 405)</b>
<p><b>...but the yolks, especially fresh ones, from the hen, partridge,
and pheasant, warm the heart and nourish the body when they are eaten lightly
cooked, for eggs ought to be sucked. They are converted into pure blood,
which warms the heart. For this reason, those who are troubled by an empty
stomach should use this food often in the first course because it is very
easily turned into other humors when the stomach is purged beforehand.
(Milham, 161, 163)</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe: Stuffed Eggs</b>
<p><b>For 160</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>160 whole hard boiled eggs&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>20 whole egg whites, raw (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>7/8 cup fresh marjoram, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>7/8 cup fresh mint leaves, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>7/8 cup fresh parsley, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>7/8 cup fresh chives, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/3 tablespoons salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 2/3 tablespoons freshly ground pepper&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 2/3 tablespoons raisins, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 1/2 cups grated cheese - use a fresh cheese, like Farmer's, not a
hard cheese like Parmesan</b></li>

<li>
<b>3/8 cup vinegar</b></li>

<li>
<b>additional grated cheese, for sprinkling</b></li>
</ul>
<b>For 8&nbsp;</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>8 whole hard boiled eggs&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 whole egg whites, raw (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 teaspoons fresh marjoram, minced&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 teaspoons fresh mint leaves, minced&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 teaspoons fresh parsley, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 teaspoons fresh chives, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 teaspoon salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/3 teaspoons raisins, minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 tablespoons grated cheese - use a fresh cheese, like Farmer's, not
a hard cheese like Parmesan</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 teaspoon vinegar</b></li>

<li>
<b>additional grated cheese, for sprinkling</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Hard boil the eggs and cool completely. Peel carefully, trying to avoid
damaging the whites. Slice each egg in half lengthwise and carefully remove
the yolk. Set aside the whites.</b>
<p><b>Take the yolks and place them in a bowl. Add all the remaining ingredients
and combine well. The final result should be of creamy consistency. If
the mixture appears too dry to be easily placed in the reserved egg halves
without sticking, add more vinegar in very small amounts until the desired
consistency is reached.</b>
<p><b>Spoon the yolk mixture into the egg white halves (a pastry bag and
wide-opening tip can help with this). You will not use all of the yolk
filling! Once the eggs are assembled, take the rest of the filling and
thin it with a little vinegar and possibly some of the egg whites to make
a sauce. Set this sauce aside.</b>
<p><b>Reassemble the eggs so they appear whole, then fry them gently in
oil and top with the sauce. Alternatively, arrange the reassembled eggs
in a greased baking dish and pour the sauce over them. Sprinkle the remaining
cheese over them and bake until golden brown and heated through, approximately
15 minutes.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>This recipe is a relatively straightforward. After the hardboiled
eggs are stuffed with the requisite ingredients, Platina calls for the
eggs to be reassembled and subsequently fried in oil over low heat. The
fried eggs are then served with a sauce made from reserved egg yolks, cinnamon,
verijuice, and must.</b>
<p><b>In order for the eggs to be reassembled properly, less than half
the yolks would need to be used or the filling would not all fit back into
the hardboiled white halves. Modern recipes for stuffed eggs typically
fill both white halves with a big dollop of yolk-based filling and avoid
the reassembly altogether. If further cooking is done in modern recipes,
the eggs are not usually fried, but baked and topped with a b&eacute;chamel
(white sauce) or similar simple sauce.</b>
<p><b>Older eggs are much easier to peel than fresh eggs. Eggs can be hard-boiled
in advance. Using cake frosting bags and tips, the eggs can be filled just
prior to being served, making transport much easier. Consider skipping
the final baking or frying step completely and take these eggs as a lovely
alternative to stuffed-deviled eggs at your next party.</b>
