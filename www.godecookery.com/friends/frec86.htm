<center><b>Chicken &amp; cheese meat balls - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipe from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>For ten guests, boil a pound of pork or veal belly well. When it
is cooked and cut up, add half a pound of aged cheese and a little fat,
and mix with fragrant herbs, well cut up, pepper, ginger, and cloves. Some
even add breast of capon, well pounded. When these have all been worked
with meal and reduced to a thin sheet, roll into balls the size of a chestnut.
When rolled, cook in rich juice and color with saffron. They require little
cooking. When they are transferred to serving dishes, sprinkle with ground
cheese and rather sweet spices. It is also possible for this food to be
made from breast of pheasant, partridge, or other fowl. (Milham, 333)</b>

<b>The preparation of this recipe closely mimics any number of modern meatball
recipes in today's popular cookbooks. Instead of using precooked pork or
veal, we'll be using chicken exclusively, as per the suggestion at the
end of the original recipe.</b>
<p><b>To begin, take chicken and grind it to a paste in a large food processor
or chop it very finely by hand with a knife. To the meat, add cheese, parsley,
thyme, pepper, ginger, cloves and bread crumbs. Mix the additions well
with the meat, being sure all ingredients are evenly distributed. Once
completely mixed, form into chestnut-sized balls and set aside.</b>
<p><b>In a large pot over high heat, bring to boil the veal stock. When
the stock is boiling rapidly, add the meatballs in batches to the pot.
Be sure not to overcrowd the pot or the meatballs will cook unevenly. The
meatballs will sink nearly to the bottom of the pot. Cook the meatballs
until they rise to the top of the pot (it should take approximately 8-15
minutes per batch depending on the size of the meatballs). Remove the meatballs
from the boiling liquid using a slotted spoon. Place the meatballs on a
serving dish, sprinkle lightly with cheese, and garnish with parsley sprigs.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>To precooked pork or veal, Platina says to add aged cheese, fat,
spices, meal, and possibly more meat in the form of fowl well pounded.
The entire mixture is worked into a thin sheet and then rolled into chestnut-sized
balls. These small meat balls are then cooked (using some unstated method)
in a rich broth that has been colored with saffron and subsequently served
sprinkled with sweet spices (none are specifically named) and more cheese.</b>
<p><b>Nowhere in Platina's book does he mention specifically what a rich
broth is, though many researchers have argued this very point. Presumably,
the medieval cook would know, but the modern cook can only guess. In our
opinion, we cannot assume that a rich broth today resembles one created
in Platina's time period.</b>
<p><b>Platina mentions at the very end of the recipe that some people make
this with breast of fowl, though it is unclear if he means exclusively
from bird meat, or if he means to reiterate that some cooks add bird meat
to the pork or veal that is precooked.</b>
<p><b>Milham's translation footnotes:</b>
<p><b>In her translation footnotes, Milham specifically states that she
translates this recipe as meatballs, rather than as macaroni with meat
(my translation of the title). The recipe itself indeed does not discuss
pasta of any kind, but instead details a very easily reproduced version
of a popular, mundane recipe for meatballs.</b>
<p><b>Advanced preparation:</b>
<p><b>This recipe is very well suited to advanced preparation up to about
three months prior to a feast. If you have enough freezer space, we highly
recommend preparing and cooking the meatballs ahead of time up to the point
of the final sprinkling with cheese. Reheat the meatballs in the oven with
a little bit of broth for 15 minutes or keep them warm in an institutional
warmer and sprinkle the cheese over them just prior to serving.</b>
<p><b>Scaling the recipe:</b>
<p><b>When increasing the recipe amounts to serve a large number of feasters,
remember that the boiling liquid can be kept hot at all times and, thus,
reused for each additional batch of meatballs being cooked. You may need
to replenish the stock a little bit as some of it boils away during the
cooking, but a strict multiplication isn't necessary in order to vastly
increase the number of meatballs prepared. Start with the original amount
of the stock and then add more if it boils down far enough, being sure
to bring the pot back to a boil after you add more stock.</b>
<p><b>Mixing the ingredients:</b>
<p><b>A large, stand-type mixer, especially an industrial-sized one with
a beater bar can be invaluable in the preparation of this dish because
it ensures an even distribution of all the ingredients. It also helps keep
the meatballs together when they are cooking because no one meatball is
over-weighted with more or less meat than meal and cheese, the main binding
ingredients.</b>
