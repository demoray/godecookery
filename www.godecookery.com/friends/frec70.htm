<center><b>A garlic, herb, &amp; Feta cheese pat&eacute; - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipe from <i>A Taste of Ancient Rome</i> by Ilaria Giacosa,
p. 54:</b>
<p><b>Quattuor alia, apius, ruta, coriandrum, salis micas, caseus.</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe: Garlic and Herb Cheese Pat&eacute;</b>
<p><b>These ingredients in the original recipe can be translated as:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Four garlic cloves</b></li>

<li>
<b>celery</b></li>

<li>
<b>rue</b></li>

<li>
<b>coriander</b></li>

<li>
<b>salt grains</b></li>

<li>
<b>cheese.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Some ingredients require careful handling. See Safety Information below.</b>
<p><b>No instructions are given for what to do with these ingredients,
though it is easy to surmise from the name that they were combined in such
a way as to make a spoonable sauce. Some debate exists over the exact translation
of "quattuor" in that scholars disagree strongly on exactly how much garlic
is meant: four cloves or four heads of garlic. We have chosen to accept
the four clove translation rather than the four head translation because
garlic heads were smaller in during the time period and because four heads
of modern garlic would completely overpower the dish so that only the truly
intrepid garlic fiend would brave it. Also note, the cook seems free to
choose exactly which type of cheese to use and whether or not to use fresh
coriander (cilantro) or dried.</b>
<p><b>For 160</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>10 small bulbs of fresh garlic (or more to taste), finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>4 3/8 pounds fresh feta cheese</b></li>

<li>
<b>20 stalks celery, finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>10 small bunches coriander leaves, finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>10 small bunches of fresh rue leaves, finely minced; OPTIONAL: See Safety
Information below</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/4 cup olive oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>5/8 quart white wine vinegar</b></li>
</ul>
<b>For 8</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1/2 bulb fresh garlic (or more to taste), finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/2 ounces fresh feta cheese</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/2 stalks celery, finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 small bunch of coriander leaves, finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 small bunch of fresh rue leaves, finely minced; OPTIONAL: See Safety
Information below</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tablespoon olive oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Break up the bulbs of garlic into cloves and remove them from their
papery skins. Mince the garlic finely or use a food processor or a mortar
and pestle to reduce it to paste. Roughly chop celery, cheese, and herbs,
then combine until smooth in a food processor. Alternatively, finely mince
the celery and herbs and set them aside. If you are not using a food processor,
add these finely minced ingredients to feta which you have pounded in a
mortar until it is smooth and creamy. Add vinegar and oil to the cheese
and process until smooth, either with a food processor or by hand in a
bowl. Combine all ingredients and let sit for at least 15 minutes, preferably
overnight, to allow flavors to mingle.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>Safety Information:</b>
<p><b>Rue <i>(Ruta graveolens)</i> contains a volatile oil and alkaloids,
both known to be responsible for this plant having been used to treat indigestion,
among other ailments, during our researched time period. However, because
of its ability to strongly influence the female menstrual cycle, consumption
of Rue by pregnant women or women trying to conceive should be avoided
even in the smallest amounts. Consider omitting the Rue altogether.</b>
<p><b>Vinegar and oil use:</b>
<p><b>Although the original recipe did not call for them, we added a small
amount of vinegar and oil to the dish. The cheese we used to make the dish
was dry enough to make the pat&eacute; crumbly rather than spoonable or
suitable for dipping. It required some liquid to smooth it out. A straight
oil addition made the cheese seem greasy, but the addition of the vinegar
added a smoothing quality that resulted in the texture we had hoped to
achieve with the original recipe. In Platina, both ingredients would have
been listed as suitable for this combination based on their inherent humoral
qualities. The vinegar may have been used to repress the heat of the garlic
and instill the desire to eat at the beginning of the feast (Milham, pg.
167) and the oil of olives in particular was often used to induce a healthy
appetite (Milham, pg. 151).</b>
<p><b>Garlic and the amounts used:</b>
<p><b>Adjust the amount of garlic in this recipe to suit the tastes of
your feasters. The garlic will overpower the dish easily, but for "garlic
fiends" this may be ideal. By letting the dish sit for at least 15 minutes
the flavor of the fresh coriander leaves is also tamed. Some feasters may
liken the taste of fresh coriander to the smell of medicine. We recommend
making the moretum a day ahead and letting it sit overnight so the garlic
flavor and the coriander flavor permeate and meld properly with the cheese.</b>
<p><b>For garlic aficionados, consider this alternative to reducing the
amount of garlic: increase the amount of garlic, but roast it or bake it
first before removing the papery skins. This will mellow out the flavor
and give the dish a little more sweet tang to counteract the often salty
taste of the feta cheese. Garlic can be roasted several days in advance,
removed from its skin, and saved in a well-sealed dish until the rest of
the ingredients can be combined.</b>
<p><b>Many people find the convenience of pre-minced, bottle garlic worth
considering for a feast, especially one in which large amounts of garlic
will be used. The time saved by using this product may outweigh the disadvantage
we believe exists with using a preserved and canned product. To our taste
buds, however, the use of bottled garlic in this dish enhances the acidity
of the preservative in the garlic and the slightly cooked taste of the
spice. Therefore, instead of bottled garlic, we recommend obtaining the
whole, pre-peeled garlic cloves often offered at restaurant supply stores.</b>
