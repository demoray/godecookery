<center><b>How to harvest rose petals and make rose jam &amp; syrup - <font color="#000000">by
Sharon Cohen</font></b></center>

<p><b>The 1552 edition of <i>Banckes Herbal</i> contains a woodcut of three
Tudor roses, a crown and a ribbon banner proclaiming the rose to be <i>"The
Kynge of floures,"</i> an opinion that seems to be shared by the people
of 16th century England. Of course, the rose was the symbol of the royal
family, but it was also a favorite embroidery motif, probably the most
common floral motif in use at the time.</b>
<p><b>Herbalists and the writers of household recipe books were also fond
of roses. John Gerard, whose <i>Generall Historie of Plantes</i> was first
published in 1597, devotes no less than twelve pages to the description
and virtues of roses, far more that he gives to any other herb. (The title
of this article comes from his description.) Sir Hugh Plat, who published
his <i>Delightes for Ladies</i> in 1609, has 16 recipes for preserving
roses in various forms.</b>
<p><b>The recipes (or <i>"prescriptions"</i> as the herbalists like to
call them) are for things like rose-water, rose oil, rose honey or sugar,
rose syrup and conserve of roses. All these item were used for cosmetic,
medicinal and/or culinary purposes. Rose products were thought to be good
for the skin, cooling and soothing to the digestive and the respiratory
systems, and gentle enough that even the very old and the very young could
tolerate them.</b>
<p><b><font color="#800000">A disclaimer:</font> While these treats were
used medicinally in the 16th century (some examples follow each recipe),
these recipes are not meant for anything other than culinary uses.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Harvesting Rose Petals</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#800000">Warning:</font> Most roses today are grown
for ornamental purposes, and are usually treated with chemical pesticides
and systemic rose food. While these help the rose plant produce more and
healthier flowers, they make the flowers extremely toxic. Therefore, it
is very important that no chemical pesticides or systemic rose food have
been used on the rose plants for at least one year before harvesting for
human consumption. You can be sure of this by (<font color="#800000">A</font>)
growing the roses yourself in your own garden (but keep an eye on your
gardener, if you have one -- often they will feed your roses every year
without mentioning it to you) or (<font color="#800000">B</font>) knowing
the person who does the growing. If you are not 100% sure, do not use the
roses.</b>
<p><b>Having made sure of the non-toxicity of the petals in question, they
should be picked in the early morning, after the dew has dried. Cut flowers
that are fully open, but the petals should not have started to wilt too
much. (A few wilted petals are all right -- they will be eliminated in
processing.) The whole flower head should be cut, as this will encourage
the plant to produce more blooms.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Note: In the 16th century crimson Damask roses were grown by the
acre, so cooks of that time had access to roses that a 20th century cook
can only dream of. It is not necessary that all your petals be from red
roses -- any scented rose will do. I have made both rose petal jam and
rose syrup using a mixture of petals of all colors, and as long as at least
some of the petals are red, the results have still been dark red.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Once all the roses have been cut, carefully remove the petals from
the rosehip, discarding any petals that are wilted or damaged. If at all
possible, this should be done outdoors because there will be an incredible
number of insects inside each flower (no pesticides, remember?) and you'll
want to keep them outside the house.</b>
<p><b>At the base of each petal is a small white patch, called the <i>"nailes"</i>
by John Gerard and the <i>"whights"</i> by Lady Elinore Fettiplace. It
should be removed using a small sharp scissors, as it will add a bitter
taste to the final product.</b>
<p><b>Finally, the petals should be rinsed thoroughly with cool running
water and allowed to air dry. They are now ready to be cooked.</b>
<p><b>The first rule of preserving, like that of medicine, is "Do no harm,"
which means (in our case) do not let bacteria get into your preserves.
Before you start, wash all pots, utensils, and kitchen surfaces with hot,
soapy water and rinse well.</b>

<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>To Make A Conserve Of Roses</font></font></b></center>

<ul><b>Take Red Rose budds, Cut of the whights then boyle them in water
untill they bee very tender, then wey to every pound of Roses and water
3 poundes of sugar and boyle yt together till it be thicke enough stirr
yt still on the fire and untill yt be colde then put yt in glasses and
preserve yt to yor use. - Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book, compiled 1604
Conserve Of Red Roses The same can be made another way, but better by many
degrees: take the Roses at your pleasure, put them to boyle in faire water,
having regard for the quantity; ,for if you have many roses, you may take
the more water; if fewer, the less water will serve: the which you shall
boyle the least three or foure houres, even as you would boyle a piece
of meat, until in the eating they be very tender, at which time the roses
will lose their colour, that you would think your labor lost and the thing
spoiled. But proceed, for though the roses have lost their colour, the
water has gotten the tincture thereof, then shall you add unto one pound
of Roses, foure pound of fine sugar in pure powder, and so according to
the rest of the roses. Thus shall you let them boyle gently after the Sugar
is put thereto, continually stirring it with a wooden Spatula until it
be cold, whereof one pound weight is worth six pound of the crude or raw
conserve, as well for the vertues and goodnesse in taste, as also for the
beautifull colour.</b>
<br><b>- John Gerard, <i>The Herbal, or General History of Plants.</i></b></ul>
<b>Modern recipe:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1/2 pound rose petals, cleaned and trimmed as above</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup water</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 or 4 pounds sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>two 8-oz. (or four 4-oz.) jam jars processed according to directions
on the package.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Put the petals and water in an enamel or other non-reactive pot, cover
and stew gently for about 30 minutes until all color has been leached out
of the petals. (Don't worry about this -- they'll turn red when the sugar
is added.)</b>
<p><b>Increase heat and add the sugar, one pound at a time, letting each
pound dissolve completely before adding the next. Three pounds of sugar,
as Lady Fettiplace suggests, results in a somewhat runny jam, while four
pounds of sugar will most likely cause the rose petals to crystallize (not
necessarily a bad thing) in the jar. The amount of sugar you add will depend
on the result you want.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>When the last of the sugar is dissolved, bring the mixture to a boil.
Boil until the mixture thickens and a drop placed on a cold plate forms
a skin when it is pushed with a spoon. Overcooking the mixture can result
in the entire batch of jam crystallizing once it is in the jar.* Remove
from heat and quickly ladle the jam into the hot sterilized jam jars. Carefully
wipe any spilled jam away from the outside of the jars, then apply the
seals and rings.</b>
<p><b>*If this happens, the jam can be re-melted by putting the entire
jar (unsealed) into a bowl and adding hot water up to about an inch below
the lip of the jar. Leave the jar there (changing the water as needed to
keep it hot) until the jam is sufficiently melted.</b>
<p><b>Note: because the ratio of rose petals to sugar is so high, this
jam does not need to be heat-processed after the jars are sealed. The high
sugar content acts as a preservative and prevents the growth of bacteria.
The jam should be refrigerated after the jar is opened.</b>
<p><b>This jam has a very delicate flavor and can be used for any purpose
as any other flavor of jam except one: peanut butter sandwiches. The strong
flavor of peanut butter totally overwhelms rose-petal jam. Lady Fettiplace
used her conserve for cheer and comfort the ill, incidentally while hiding
the flavor of her more noxious medicines. Herbalists tended to prescribe
it for coughs, colds and lung complaints.</b>

<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>A Singular manner of making the
sirup of Roses</font></font></b></center>

<ul><b>Fill a silver Basin three quarters full of rain-water or Rose-water:
put therein a conveient proportion of Rose-leaves: cover the basin and
set it upon a pot of hot water (as we usually bake a custard) in 3 quarters
of an houre, or one whole houre at most, you shal purchase the whole strength
and tincture of the rose: then take out those leaves, wringing out their
liquor gently, and steepe more fresh leaves in the same water: continue
this iteration seven time, then make it up in a sirup: and this sirup worketh
more kindly than that which is made meerly of the juice of the Rose.</b>
<br><b>- Sir Hugh Plat, <i>Delighes For Ladies,</i> published 1609.</b></ul>

<center><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>To Make A Serop Of Roses</font></font></b></center>

<ul><b>Take damask rose buds six handsfulls, &amp; cut of the tops, and
take a quart of faire running water, &amp; put the roses therein, &amp;
put them in a basin &amp; set them over the fire, that the water may be
warm one day and night, then in the morning squise the roses hard between
your hands out of the water, &amp; put in as many fresh, &amp; let them
stand still on the fire, this doe nine times, then take out your roses,
cleane out of the water, &amp; put in as much sugar as will make it sweet,
and boyle it till it come to a serop; you must put to everie pinte a pound
of sugar.</b>
<br><b>- <i>Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book,</i> compiled 1604.</b></ul>
<b>Modern recipe:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Clean and trimmed rose petals</b></li>

<li>
<b>Water</b></li>

<li>
<b>Sugar</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Put two handfuls of petals into the top of an enamel double boiler (or
a Pyrex casserole suspended over a pot of water) with just enough water
to cover them and put them over gently simmering water. Although Lady Fettiplace
states that it should be on the fire for a day and a night, Sir Hugh Plat
points out that 45 minutes to a hour will <i>"purchase the whole strength
and tincture of the Rose."</i> An hour is long enough for even the darkest
petals to bleach absolutely white. Take the mixture off the fire and allow
it to cool enough to be handled, then remove and discard the petals, squeezing
as much liquid from them as possible. Put in two handfuls of fresh petals
and repeat the procedure.</b>
<p><b>Lady Fettiplace's recipe calls for this to be repeats nine times,
although Sir Hugh recommends seven changes and other contemporary recipes
call for as few as three changes. How many changes you will get depends
on how many rose petals you have. No additional water is added for each
successive change, so the liquid will decrease in volume as it becomes
concentrated.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>The end result will be a dark red, almost black, liquid. For every
pint of liquid, add one pound of sugar and boil the mixture gently until
it thickens. The longer it is boiled, the thicker the resulting syrup be,
but do not cook it too much or it will lose its fresh rose taste and aroma.</b>
<p><b>Pour the finished syrup into a clean bottle or jar with an air-tight
closure, let it cool, and store it in the refrigerator, where it will stay
good for years, if it lasts that long.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Lady Fettiplace used this syrup to flavor cool drinks in summer and
to also hide or counteract the strong flavors of some of her medicinal
remedies. John Gerard recommends rose syrup to cool the heat of fevers
and agues, as a thirst quencher (taken with white wine) and for mild stomach
problems. (Actually, he goes on to describe in medically gruesome detail
the benefits to the whole digestive tract.) Nicholas Culpepper recommended
it to cool the liver and comfort the heart and notes that a small dose
taken every night will help with regularity. <i>Banckes Herbal</i> recommends
syrup of roses for <i>"feble sicke melacoly and colorike people."</i></b>
