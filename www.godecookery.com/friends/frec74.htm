<center><b>Detailed instructions for preparing sugarplums, the quintessential
Christmas sweet, <font color="#000000">by Sharon Cohen</font></b></center>

<p><b>The dictionary defines a sugarplum as a small round or oval piece
of sugary candy. English being the flexible language it is, the name could
have come from the resemblance to a small plum. Or it could have come from
actual plums preserved in sugar, a relatively new idea in 16th Century
England. Prior to this time sugar was so expensive that it was used very
sparingly, much as we would use a spice today. In the 1540's, however,
sugar started being refined in London which lowered the price considerably,
although only well-off families were able to use it lavishly. Preserving
with sugar allowed the sweet fruits of summer to be enjoyed all year round,
especially during the holiday season.</b>
<p><b>16th Century cooks did not record their reasons for using one ingredient
over another, although they seem to enjoy very much trading recipes and
most of those who wrote down their recipes were scrupulous about attributing
them to their original creators. Some recipes have delightful names such
as <i>"The Lord of Devonshire, His Pudding."</i></b>
<p><b>Herbalists of the day, however, had a great deal to say about the
produce and seasonings used. John Gerard, whose <i>Complete Herbal</i>
was first published in 1597, says of fresh plums that they provide very
little nourishment and moreover have a tendency to spoil quickly and taint
any dish they are served in. Dried plums, or prunes, he says, are much
more wholesome and he recommends them for problem in the digestive system.
Thomas Culpepper, writing somewhat later, finds virtue in both the fresh
and dried fruit.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Gerard also has a bit to say about sugar cane and the product of
its juice, sugar. In addition to listing the benefits of sugar to the respiratory
and digestive systems, he starts to list the culinary goodies which can
be made with it. He then points out <i>"it is not my purpose to make my
book a Confectionairie, a Sugar Bakers furnace, a Gentlewoman's preserving
pan..."</i> He also offers a thumbnail sketch of sugar refining.</b>
<p><b>Whether 16th Century cooks worried about the nutritional value --
or lack thereof -- of their holiday treats is, of course, open to conjecture.
I invite anyone who has lived through a massive holiday baking session
to ponder this question.</b>
<p><b>I first tried some 16th Century preserving techniques to make 12th
Night gifts, and now understand why sugared fruit was a treat to be saved
for special occasions. For one thing, sugared fruit is intensely fruit-flavored
and unbelievably sweet, for another it is extremely time-consuming (but
not difficult) to make. Fortunately for 12th Night gift-giving, the time
to make sugarplums is during the summer, when plums are ripe.</b>
<ul><b>TO DRIE APRICOCKS, PEACHES, PIPPINS OR PEARPLUMS</b>
<br><b>Take your apricocks or pearplums, &amp; let them boile one walme
in as much clarified sugar as will cover them, so let them lie infused
in an earthen pan three days, then take out your fruits, &amp; boile your
syrupe againe, when you have thus used them three times then put half a
pound of drie sugar into your syrupe, &amp; so let it boile till it comes
to a very thick syrup, wherein let your fruits boile leysurelie 3 or 4
walmes, then take them foorth of the syrup, then plant them on a lettice
of rods or wyer, &amp; so put them into yor stewe, &amp; every second day
turne them &amp; when they be through dry you may box them &amp; keep them
all the year; before you set them to drying you must wash them in a litlle
warme water, when they are half drie you must dust a little sugar upon
them throw a fine Lawne.</b>
<br><b><i>-- Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book, </i>1604</b></ul>
<b>Sir Hugh Plat, in his<i> Delights for Ladies</i> (published 1609), seems
to have more faith in his readers' culinary skills, as his recipe is much
simpler:</b>
<ul><b>THE MOST KINDELY WAY TO PRESERVE PLUMS, CHERRIES, GOOSEBERIES, &amp;c.</b>
<br><b>You must first purchase some reasonable quanity of their owne juyce,
with a gentle heat upon embers, in pewter dishes. dividing the juice still
as it commeth in the strewing: then boile each fruit in his own juyce,
with a convenient proportion of the best refined sugar.</b></ul>
<b>You will need:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1-2 pounds of plums (any variety) fully ripe but not too soft</b></li>

<li>
<b>lots of white granulated sugar (unfortunately I cannot be more exact)</b></li>

<li>
<b>a large, heavy saucepan, preferably enamel</b></li>

<li>
<b>a wire rack -- a cookie cooling rack works very well -- set up over
a cookie sheet covered with wax paper.</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Wash the plums, cut them in half and remove the pits (this is a lot
easier if you're using a freestone variety). Lady Fettiplace, you may have
noticed, does not mention this step, and may have indeed preserved her
plums whole. Since the resulting candy is incredibly sweet, I found that
preserving the plums cut in half makes a more reasonable serving of the
final product.</b>
<p><b>Do not peel the plums -- the peel helps them keep their shape while
cooking and colors the sugarplums, and most of the peel will come off during
processing. The idea is to preserve each half as complete as possible,
so you want to avoid breaking down the cellulose structure of the plums.
Since the act of cooking, adding heat and moisture, is exactly what breaks
down the cellulose structure of food, you will see the words "gently" and
"carefully" often in the following instructions.</b>
<p><b>Put a thin layer of sugar in the bottom of the saucepan. Lady Fettiplace's
recipe calls for clarified sugar, because she was working with a less refined
sugar than we have today. She would have done the last boiling of the sugar
(the last step in modern sugar refining) herself.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Lay the plums halves, cut side down, on the sugar in a single layer.
Add enough sugar to completely cover the layer of plums, then lay another
layer of plums on top. Continue layering until all the plums have been
used and are covered.</b>
<p><b>Put the pan on the stove over the lowest heat possible. The sugar
needs to dissolve in the plum juices without burning. While this is happening,
stir very gently and scrape the sugar away from the sides of the pan. Try
to disturb the fruit as little as possible.</b>
<p><b>When all the sugar is dissolved, increase the heat until the syrup
comes to a gentle boil. (If it boils too hard, it will break up the plums.)
A <i>"walme"</i> is 16th Century culinary for a "warm" or a boiling up,
i.e., bringing liquid to a boil. Let the fruit boil for one minute, then
remove the pan from the stove. If you are NOT using an enamel pan, gently
remove the fruit from the syrup with a slotted spoon and put it in a large
shallow glass or ceramic bowl and carefully pour the syrup over it. If
you are using an enamel pan, the fruit can stay in it. Carefully place
a plate over the fruit to keep it submerged in the syrup. Cover with the
pan lid or a clean dish towel and let soak for three days.</b>
<p><b>A note about sugar: Boiling sugar can cause severe burns. It is very,
very hot and tends to stick to the skin like boiling oil. As if that wasn't
bad enough, it will also stick to your stovetop and counters with incredible
tenacity. Be careful not to splash the hot syrup when transferring the
fruit.&nbsp;</b>
<p><b>Another note: The soaking process should be at room temperature,
which means that you can leave it out on the kitchen counter or on an unused
stove burner. But beware of ants! If your kitchen is ant-prone, place the
pan or bowl in a larger container that has a few inches of water in the
bottom.</b>
<p><b>After three days, carefully remove the fruit and bring the syrup
to a boil. Gently return the fruit to the syrup, bring to a gentle boil
again and let boil for one minute. Remove from heat and repeat the soaking
process. Repeat the boiling and soaking process one more time, for a total
of nine days soaking and approximately 3 minutes boiling.</b>
<p><b>After the last soaking, remove the fruit from the syrup. Heat the
syrup again and dissolve one additional cup of sugar in it. Let the syrup
boil until it thickens somewhat (it may darken as well, depending on what
variety of plums you've use), add the fruit again and allow it to boil
gently for four minutes.</b>
<p><b>Remove the pan from the heat. With a slotted spoon, carefully remove
the plums one at a time from the syrup and rinse the excess syrup away
under cool, gently running water. Since no two plums are ever at exactly
the same degree of ripeness, some of your plums will have broken up during
processing. Never fear, they'll taste just as good as those that kept their
shape. If you wish, you may remove any peel that remains on the plums.
(Ladies in the 16th Century would have removed the peel -- I like the texture
with the peel in place.) Spread the plums on a wire rack and put in a warm
dry place. <i>"Yor stewe"</i> was a special drying stove in the 16th Century
stillroom. In the 20th century kitchen, a gas oven with just the pilot
light burning in it is perfect, but make sure you remove the plums before
preheating the oven for dinner. I've lost more plums that way, and burned
sugarplums are the stickiest mess you can imagine.</b>
<p><b>Turn the plums every other day. When the plums are almost dry (they
should still feel a bit sticky) sprinkle each side with granulated sugar.
<i>Throw
a fine Lawne</i>, as Lady Fettiplace says, is to sift the sugar through
a piece of fine linen, which is not necessary with modern sugar. The drying
time may be anywhere from a few days up to about two weeks, depending on
local weather. When the plums are completely dry, store in an air-tight
container. Plums processed in July are still soft at 12th Night and are
chewier, but still delicious, more than a year later.</b>
<p><b>I have tried this recipe with several varieties of plum. I find that
the Italian plums (prunes) work well because they are free-stone. As they
have a higher sugar content and less acid than other varieties, the final
sugarplums are much sweeter than those made from other varieties. In addition,
they tend to be smaller than other plums, which result in bite-sized sugarplums.
Lady Fettiplace probably used the Damson variety, which is a tart plum
with purple- black skin and green flesh, and is used today for jam and
jelly. Unfortunately, I've never yet been able to find Damsons, but I've
used home- grown Santa Rosa plums (which were a bit on the tart side and
ended up being totally wonderful) and the ones sold in the market as Black
plums and Red plums. All turned out equally well.</b>
<p><b>I've also processed peaches, apricots and figs this way, with good
results, and I've seen similar recipes for candied citrus peel. Figs are
not as juicy as the other fruits, so add one-half cup of water to the sugar
at the beginning to allow the sugar to dissolve before it burns. Otherwise
you'll end up with caramelized figs, which are very tasty but probably
were not served on 16th Century tables.</b>
