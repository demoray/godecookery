<center><b>Pears in a dark grape sauce - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipes from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>Sweet pears should be served as a first course, since they are juicy
and tasty, and balanced between coolness and warmth, and ought to be eaten
before the meal, like those small earliest pears which Pliny called "proud."
It has been said that pears nourish the body better than other fruits...
Pears are preserved in many ways as grapes.... (Milham, 137)</b>
<p><b>You can also preserve green grapes this way. Take unblemished grapes
from the vine and cook down in river water to one-third. Put this together
with fresh grapes in a well-sealed jar so that air cannot enter... in seasoning
apples and pears we sometimes use condensed grape in place of condensed
must. (Milham, 139, 141)</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe: Pears in Dark Grape Sauce</b>
<p><b>For 160</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>80 whole pears peeled, cored, and halved lengthwise</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 1/2 gallons 100% unsweetened grape juice</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 1/2 gallons water</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 7/8 gallons sugar (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>20 very thin slices of lemon zest</b></li>

<li>
<b>60 whole cloves (or fewer)</b></li>

<li>
<b>60 cardamom pods (or fewer)</b></li>

<li>
<b>20 2-inch-long cinnamon sticks for garnishing (or fewer)</b></li>

<li>
<b>fresh mint leaves for garnishing, washed and dried</b></li>
</ul>
<b>For 8</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>4 whole pears peeled, cored, and halved lengthwise</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 quart 100% unsweetened grape juice</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 quart water</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/2 cups sugar (optional)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 very thin slice of lemon zest</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 whole cloves cardamom pods</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 2-inch-long cinnamonstick for garnishing</b></li>

<li>
<b>fresh mint leaves for garnishing, washed and dried</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Place zest, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom pods in a muslin spice bag
or piece of tied cheesecloth. In a saucepan, combine grape juice, water,
and the cloth spice bag. Add the optional sugar at this point if you desire.
Bring the contents of the saucepan to a boil. If you've added the optional
sugar, stir the contents until the sugar is completely dissolved. Turn
down the heat and carefully add pears. Simmer the pears until they are
translucent at the edges. For fresh pears, this may take as little as 8
minutes or as long as 40, depending on ripeness and the size of the pears.
For canned pears, 8 minutes is typically plenty of time.</b>
<p><b>Remove the saucepan from heat and let the contents cool to room temperature.
Remove the spice bag and discard it. Remove the pears with a slotted spoon
to a storage or serving platter. If the syrup is too thin, place the pan
back on the burner and boil the liquid until thicker and syrupy.</b>
<p><b>To serve, spoon syrup over pears and garnish with a small amount
of fresh mint.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>Pears were a winter fruit. In order to save some for the Spring season,
they would have to be preserved in some way to keep them fresh. Platina
suggests the procedure in the write-up on pears and then proceeds to detail
it in the write-up on grapes. Grapes are cooked down for their juice. The
fruit to be preserved, usually grapes, but in this case, pears, is submerged
in the condensed grape juice and then sealed in airtight jars until they
are used.</b>
<p><b>Changing or eliminating the sweetener:</b>
<p><b>The sugar in this recipe does not seem to overpower the pears, but
the resulting product is a sweet and firm piece of fruit. You may, however,
wish to reduce or eliminate the sugar if the pears are particularly ripe
at the time of preparation or if you simply wish a less sweet product.
The sweetness of the grape juice will directly affect how sweet your pears
are. Be sure to taste the grape juice in advance to best judge how much
sweetener will be needed, if any.</b>
<p><b>Home canning:</b>
<p><b>This recipe survives the home canning process well. Follow the instructions
in any canning book that details the canning of fruit. To complete the
recipe with juice only, reducing the sweetness of the overall product,
look in the low-sugar or diabetic section of any good book on home canning.</b>
<p><b>Spices and recipe scaling:</b>
<p><b>As you make this recipe in larger quantities, you may find that the
amount of spices overall can be reduced slightly to suit your tastes. Cloves
have a particular strong flavor that some feasters find too much for their
palate. Cooked in small batches, servings of no more than 16, the spices
seem to work well, but in larger quantities (sometimes possible in institutional
kitchens) we believe the amounts of the spices do not appear to multiply
accordingly.</b>
