<center><b>Pears, nuts, &amp; cream in a baked pie shell - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Yonnie Travis</font></b></center>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Pears</b></li>

<li>
<b>4 cups cold water</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 cups sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 two-inch piece of vanilla bean, split in half lengthwise</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 Tbs. fresh lemon juice</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 pears</b></li>
</ul>
<b>In a 3 quart casserole bring water, sugar, vanilla bean, and lemon juice
to a boil. Stir until sugar dissolves then remove from heat.</b>
<p><b>One at a time peel pears, cut in half lengthwise and remove stems
and cores, dropping each pear in syrup as you proceed. Shape one of the
halves into a peachlike round by cutting off the stem end. The syrup should
cover pears completely; if necessary add more water.</b>
<p><b>Bring to a simmer over moderate heat, reduce to low and poach for
10-15 minutes, or until pears show only slight resistance when pierced
with point of a small knife. Remove pan from the heat and let pears cool
in the syrup. With a slotted spoon arrange the pears, core side down, on
a rack to drain.</b>
<p><b>Frangipane Cream:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1/2 cup whole blanched almonds</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 cups milk</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 two-inch piece of vanilla bean split in half</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 eggs</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 egg yolks</b></li>

<li>
<b>3/4 cup sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup flour</b></li>

<li>
<b>6 Tbs. unsalted butter</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 Tbs. blanched chopped pistachios</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cup kirsch</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/2 cups apricot jam</b></li>

<li>
<b>9" pastry shell baked in a fluted quiche pan</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Toast almonds in a preheated 350&deg; F oven. Pulverize in a blender,
grinder, or mortar and pestle.</b>
<p><b>In a heavy 3 quart saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla over moderate
heat until small bubbles appear around the edge of the pan. Remove the
pan from the heat and cover.</b>
<p><b>With a wisk, beat the eggs and the egg yolks together in a large
bowl until the eggs are thick enough to fall in a ribbon when lifted from
the bowl. Add the flour 1/4 cup at a time. When all the flour is absorbed,
remove vanilla bean from the milk and add hot milk to the bowl in a thin
stream, beating all the while.*</b>
<p><b>Stirring deeply into the sides and bottom of the pan with a whisk
or a wooden spoon, simmer over moderate heat 3-5 minutes until the mixture
thickens into a smooth heavy cream. Do not let the cream boil at any point,
but simmer just long enough to remove any raw flour taste.</b>
<p><b>Pour the mixture into a bowl and stir in the 6 tbs. butter bits.
Add almonds, and 1/2 cup kirsch, and let cool to room temperature, stirring
every now and then to prevent a skin from forming on the top. Refrigerate
until chilled.</b>
<p><b>Before assembling tart, rub apricot jam through a sieve into a small
saucepan with the back of a spoon. Then add 1/4 cup of kirsch, stirring
constantly until mixture clears.</b>
<p><b>To assemble tart, spread a thin layer of the apricot glaze on the
bottom of the pastry shell. Spoon in the cream, spreading until smooth.
Set the pear round in the center and arrange the pear halves so that they
radiate out like the spokes of a wheel. Press pears gently into the cream.
Brush glaze over the pears and sprinkle with pistachios. Refrigerate again,
remove from fridge 15 minutes before serving.</b>
<p><b>Variations:</b>
<p><b>In the Tart recipe ingredients, substitute 2 strips of lemon peel
for the vanilla bean.</b>
<p><b>Keep the poached pears halved, not round, &amp; instead of placing
in a baked pie shell put them in really pretty bowls and pour the rosewater
cream (see below) over top. Sprinkle on crunched pistachios or almonds.</b>
<p><b>In the Cream recipe ingredients, substitute 1 tbs. rosewater for
the vanilla bean.</b>
<p><b>*When using rosewater as a substitute, heat the milk and rosewater
together, add the eggs and flour, and cook on the stove; it will never
actually set, but instead become a thin sort of custard sauce, which is
also quite good!</b>
<p><b>The original version of this recipe comes from <i>Time Life Foods
of the World: Classic French Cooking</i>.</b>
