<center><b>A pork pie seasoned with egg yolks &amp; herbs - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Rebecca A. C. Smith</font></b></center>

<ul>
<li>
<b>1 1/4 lbs pork loin, boneless, trimmed of fat and thinly sliced</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 egg yolks</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/8 tsp each pepper, mace and ground cloves</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 tsp each sage, thyme and ground nutmeg</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 tsp salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 tbsp butter diced</b></li>
</ul>
<b>The original recipe called for about 2/3 of the meat to be pork loin
and the remaining 1/3 veal. Good veal being something of great expense,
I decided to just use all pork. Rabisha's recipe also specified a different
seasoning blend for each meat. Following Ms. Lorwin's suggestion in her
book, I divided the meat roughly into thirds, seasoning two thirds with
the pork seasoning of pepper, sage, thyme and 1/2 of the salt, and seasoning
the remaining third with the "veal" seasoning of mace, nutmeg, cloves and
the rest of the salt. The respective seasoning blends are each mixed with
an egg yolk and the meat stirred about in it until coated.</b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Pastry</font></b></center>

<ul>
<li>
<b>2 cups all pupose flour</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>3/4 cup margarine (as sub for butter)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cup cold water</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 egg, separated</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Sift together flour and salt. Cut in margarine with pastry cutter. Stir
in water and egg yolk with fork . When pastry has been rolled out and pie
filled, glaze with beaten egg white. This is a two-crust pie that I made
without the aid of a pie pan, but laid out on a cooking sheet. Atop the
first crust is placed half of the pork-seasoned meat and 1/3 of the butter,
then the "veal" followed by another 1/3 of the butter and the rest of the
pork topped by the remaining butter and the top crust. The diced butter
is used in place of the clarified butter with which Rabisha advised his
readers to fill the pie after baking. This was for the purpose of preservation
as pies were meant to last for a while.* That not being a problem here,
I've followed Ms. Lorwin's lead in leaving that step out. Bake at 450&deg;
F for 20 minutes, then lower heat to 350&deg; F and bake 25 minutes. For
1 table of 8 diners.</b>
