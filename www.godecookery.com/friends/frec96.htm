<center><b>A dish of leeks, salt pork, &amp; almonds - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by L. J. Spencer, Jr.</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipe from <i>Du Fait de Cuisine;</i> translation by Elizabeth
Cook:</b>
<p><b>To make white leeks, he who is in charge of them should arrange that
he has his leeks and slice them small and wash them very well and put to
boil. And take a good piece of salt chine of pork, and clean it very well
and put it to boil therewith; and when they are well boiled take them out
onto fair and clean tables, and let them save the broth in which they were
boiled, and let there be a good mortar full of blanched almonds, and then
take the broth in which the said leeks have boiled and draw up the almonds
with it, and if there is not enough of the said broth take beef or mutton
broth -- and take care that it is not too salty; and then afterward put
your bruet to boil in a fair and clean pot. And then take two fair and
clean knives and chop your leeks, and then take them and bray them in a
mortar; and, being brayed, put them into your broth, of almonds as much
as water, to boil. And the leeks being boiled, when it comes to the side
board put your meat on fair serving dishes and then the said broth of the
said leeks put on top.</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>2 Leeks, white part only&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 lb. Salt pork, sliced thinly</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup blanched Almonds, ground finely&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b><a href="http://www.godecookery.com/goderec/grec15.htm">Good broth</a>
(made without bread crumbs)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt, to taste&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup Almonds&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup Water</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Slice leeks into rounds. Rinse well to remove silt and sand. Put leeks
into a pot. Cover with water.</b>
<p><b>Rinse salt pork well. Add to leeks. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat
to medium and continue cooking until leeks are tender and pork is cooked
through.</b>
<p><b>Reserving stock, drain leeks. Measure reserved stock and add good
broth to make 1 qt. stock. Bring stock to a boil. Turn off heat. Mix almonds
with stock. Salt to taste. Separate pork from leeks then using 2 knives
finely chop leeks. Mash leeks in a mortar. Stir leeks into broth. (You
can eliminate chopping if a food processor is used for this step.) Add
leeks to stock and pour over meat. Add almonds and water. Simmer 20 minutes.
Pour leek mixture over salt pork. Serve. Makes 8 servings.</b>
<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
