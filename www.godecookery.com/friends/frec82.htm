<p><b>My redaction:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 1/2 to 2 lbs. stewing veal, with bones, cut into ca. 2” pieces</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 cups white wine</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 tsp. salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>water to cover (about 2-3 cups)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp. chopped fresh parsely</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp dried savory</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 tsp. dried sage</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 tsp. dried hyssop</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp. crushed Ceylonese cinnamon or 1/2 tsp ground cassia (ordinary,
or Chinese cinnamon - see note below)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp. ground dried ginger</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 tsp. crushed mace blades</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 -3 cloves, lightly crushed</b></li>

<li>
<b>4 -5 peppercorns, cracked</b></li>

<li>
<b>coffee filter (no holes) or cheesecloth</b></li>

<li>
<b>string</b></li>

<li>
<b>a small pinch of saffron</b></li>

<li>
<b>3/4 cup chopped, pitted dates</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tsp. mild white wine vinager</b></li>

<li>
<b>salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 or 4 eggs, lightly beaten</b></li>

<li>
<b>8" partially baked pie shell</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Put all the herbs and spices except for the salt and the saffron in
the coffee filter or cheesecloth and tie closed with string to make a bouquet
garni. Place this, the veal, the salt, the saffron, and the wine into a
large stew pot and add enough water so that the veal is covered. Bring
to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer uncovered until veal is tender and just
falling off the bones, (about 1&frac12; to 2 hours.). Remove veal to plate.
Bring remaining liquid back to a boil and reduce to around 1 to 1&frac12;
cups. Watch carefully when the liquid level gets low - it’s easy to overcook
and scorch the broth. Add vinager, and adjust salt if necessary (add only
a very little bit at a time). Let broth cool to lukewarm. Preheat oven
to 425&ordm; F. When veal is cool enough to handle, remove bones and gristle
and lay meat in the bottom of the pie shell along with the dates. Mix beaten
eggs with the reduced liquid and pour into pie shell. Bake 20-25 minutes
until custard is set. Let cool to room temperature and serve it forth.</b>
<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>1. Expense: This recipe was intended for professional cooks to put
on a great lord’s table. The ingredients were costly in the Middle Ages
and are still not cheap. It is a nice dish to serve to high table or if
you have an "above the salt" feast.</b>
<p><b>2. Cuts of Meat: Veal shank, used for osso bucco is very expensive,
but also very tasty! It can be cooked with less expensive stewing veal
to stretch the budget - the shank will flavor and moisten the other meat.
Another good cut would be the ribs. Loin or shoulder chops, with bones,
are not as good, but will work. Scalloppine (boneless veal sold pre-sliced),
besides being too expensive, are also too dry - a fairly cartilaginous
cut will give off the right amount of gelatin. The average American will
probably not eat the cooked cartilage, being accustomed to the tough cartilage
of beef, so I usually remove it when boning the meat -- and then eat it
myself, it being quite delicious with a lovely crunchy/tender texture (ditto
for any marrow - very sweet and flavorful, a real treat in the Middle Ages).</b>
<p><b>3. Cinnamon: Not everyone is aware that there are two types of cinnamon
available. The spice you nearly always find sold as cinnamon in this country
is actually cassia or "Chinese" cinnamon ( in the UK it may not be sold
as cinnamon.) "True" or "Ceylonese" cinnamon (<i>Zeylanicum</i>) is a lighter
brown in color than cassia; the bark (in stick form) is much thinner and
flakier; and it’s flavor is much milder and sweeter than cassia, not nearly
so hot. Both were known in Europe in the Middle Ages. It is not always
clear which one they are referring to as the term <i>"canel"</i> or <i>"canelle"</i>
was used for both. The name is from the Latin <i>"canellus"</i> meaning
<i>"little
tube"</i> as the bark was obtained rolled into stick form. I prefer to
use Ceylonese as I find the flavor to be superior. It is available mail
order from The Pepperers Guild (a SCAdian spice buying organization). I
have also seen it at other merchants - the Rialto archives have contact
info for a number of them. The Guild also sells hyssop or you may look
for it at a good "health food" store if you have one handy.</b>
<p><b>4. Bouquet garni: This means bundling the spices and herbs into cheesecloth
(I use coffee filters without the holes) to make a sort of tea bag. I do
not know if it was a medieval usage, but it allows one to serve dishes
without worrying about crunching into little bits of herb or spice bark,
leaves, or stems if your grinding tools are inadequate. It is a standard
practice in classic 19’th-20’th French cooking, so much so that the ingredients
are not even specified in many recipes.</b>
<p><b>5. Saffron: saffron is the stamen (the female reproductive organ)
of a particular type of crocus. Considering how many threads (stamens)
of saffron you get from one crocus and the fact that it must be hand harvested,
it is correspondingly expensive. It commonly comes from Spain. The threads
are a bright orange red and give a beautiful yellow color and unique flavor
to any recipe they are added to. A true Spanish paella cannot be made without
it. It will photodegrade, even more so than most spices - store it in a
dark cool place.</b>
<p><b>6. Verjuice is the juice of unripe (green) grapes. It is already
sour when pressed, however, due to the lower sugar content it will not
develop nearly as high an acidity as vinegar in which the sugar in the
ripe grapes ferments to alcohol which sours to acetic acid. Note however
that in the United States most vinegars are diluted to a standard 5% acidity.
Imported Italian vinegars can run as high as 8%-10% acidity. Vinegar in
the Middle Ages was probably not diluted and had a fairly high acid content.
I feel that a mild US wine vinegar will probably approximate the taste
of verjuice reasonably well; it is also much more easily available.</b>
<p><b>7. Eggs: Casting eggs through a strainer will result in a lightly
beaten egg, which is what I have specified. If you are wondering why they
bothered with the strainer, find a picture of a medieval whisk. It was
a lot easier to push it through a strainer, a common utensil in large medieval
kitchens. Another reason why you might want to use a strainer....please
remember that most eggs sold in the US are unfertilized eggs from hens
that have never seen a rooster; not a common situation in medieval chicken
coops. If a fertile egg is a little older than just laid ... well, you
can get bits you would definitely want to strain out of your eggs.</b>
<p><b>8. Pie crusts, flours and fats: White flour, which has the bran (outer
husk) and germ removed, was not available in the Middle Ages. Fine flour
was produces by extra fine milling and then sifting the flout through progressively
finer strainers. If you wish to use whole wheat for a more authentic crust,
remember to use soft wheat (low gluten) pastry flour, available at most
“health food” stores. The stuff sold at the grocery store is almost always
hard wheat (high gluten ) bread flour. Even with soft wheat flour, a whole
wheat crust is more difficult to work with as well as tougher that made
with white flour. Many people blend white and wheat; this is probably equivalent
to finely "bolted" (sifted) medieval flour, as proportionately more of
the coarser bran and germ would be removed by sifting. Medieval recipes
I have seen do not go into detail about pie crusts since they presumed
their readers were already expert chefs and thus would already know how
to make something as basic as <i>"fayre coffins."</i> Butter, lard and
various oils were probably all used depending on availability and religious
observance (butter and lard, being of animal origin, could not be used
during Lent). An all butter crust will be tasty but very brittle, especially
if the flour is high in gluten. Rendered lard makes an excellent (if cholesterol
laden) crust. I cannot find good, solid lard for pie crusts here in the
South: it is mostly used for frying and is designed to be melted. It was
readily available in New England (in sticks much like butter) where a sizable
French-Canadian ethnic minority would not dream of making torti&egrave;re
with anything else. As a substitute for lard you can use vegetable oil
shortening, or mix some of it in with your butter to make the crust less
brittle. Vegetable oil shortening is a modern invention - when old recipes
refer to shortening, they mean butter or lard. It is made from oil which
is artificially saturated to make it solid at room temperature. The more
saturated the fat the higher the temperature at which it will remain solid.
Solid fats generally product a better pie crust, flaky but not crumbly.
Oil crusts are more difficult to work with and take a good deal of practice.
A good low fat or a health food cookbook such as <i>"Laurel’s Kitchen"</i>
(I don’t have the publishing data handy) should have instructions on making
one, as they are much lower in saturated fat, depending on the oil used.
A health food cookbook will also give instructions on working with whole
wheat crusts. Or you could just use premade frozen crusts from the grocery
store. They are not nearly as authentic, but very, very much easier!</b>
<p><b>9. Substitutions: If cost is an issue, this dish may also be made
using skinned dark meat chicken and a half packet of unflavored gelatin
since veal is naturally more gelatinous than chicken. Without the gelatin
the filling can get somewhat runny. The skin should be removed so the broth
will not be too fatty. If you use boneless chicken, increase the gelatin
to a full packet. The pie is still quite good, although the flavor is not
as delicate as when it is made with veal. Some turmeric or a drop or two
of yellow food coloring can be substituted for the saffron, but again,
the flavor will suffer.</b>
