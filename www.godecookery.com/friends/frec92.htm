<center><b>Spitted and roasted veal with spices - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipe from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>On Meat, Roman Style. Cut veal into pieces not larger than an egg
so that no piece is completely cut from another, and sprinkle at once with
salt and coriander or ground fennel. When they are sprinkled, press a little
between two boards. When a spit has been passed through them, turn them
over the fire until they are cooked, with a chunk of lard so they do not
touch and do not dry out too much. Turn them over the fire until they are
cooked. This is of great and easy nourishment, but it is digested slowly
and constipates the bowels. (Milham, 279)</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe: Spitted and Roasted Veal with Spices</b>
<p><b>For 160:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 1/4 quarts olive oil&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/3 tablespoons salt&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>3/8 cup dried coriander, ground</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/3 tablespoons dried thyme</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/3 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper</b></li>

<li>
<b>60 pounds veal&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>160 wooden skewers</b></li>
</ul>
<b>For 8:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1/4 cup olive oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 teaspoon salt&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 teaspoon dried coriander, ground&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 pounds veal</b></li>

<li>
<b>8 wooden skewers</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Excluding the meat, mix all the ingredients for a marinade. Cut the
meat into cubes weighing roughly 2 oz. each. Marinate the meat for at least
2 1/2 hours, preferably overnight. Remove the meat from the marinade (reserve
the marinade) and skewer three pieces per skewer. Roast the skewers on
a grill at high heat or broil on high for approximately 15 minutes, basting
every 5 minutes with the reserved marinade.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>A straightforward near substitute for a meat-only shishkabob might
describe this dish. Veal is cut into small chunks still somewhat attached
to one another, sprinkled immediately with spices, skewered, and roasted.
During the roasting they are somehow moistened with lard to prevent the
young meat from drying out, though the recipe does not say exactly how
(only that they are roasted with lard). They are cooked to doneness while
rotating on their spit.</b>
<p><b>We were lucky to have access to freshly butchered meat for this feast,
thus using 100% veal for the recipe. If the feast budget will not allow
the purchase of large amounts of this normally pricey meat, consider using
a combination of veal and pork. In southwestern Michigan, you can often
find the two already combined on wooden skewers at the butcher's counter
of many grocery stores. Look for it under the name "city chicken." If you
make this substitution, remember to check the cooking time of the meat
to ensure the pork is cooked through.</b>
