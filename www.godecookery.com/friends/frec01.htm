<p><b>Literal Translation:</b>
<p><b>To make Sturgeon. Take the shanks of veal and calf's feet and seeth
them in honey. And when you have seethed them all to powder, take the bones
out. In case that the flesh be long, take it a stroke or two and put it
in a fair canvas and press it well. Then take it and (slice ?) it fair
in thin (slices ?) , and not too broad. Take onions, vineger, and parsley
and lay thereon, and so serve it forth.</b>
<p><b>Probable Modern Translation:</b>
<p><b>To Make Sturgeon. Take veal shanks and calf's feet and simmer them
in honey. When you have simmered them (until the meat falls apart), take
out the bones. (If there are large pieces of flesh, chop them smaller)
and put it (the flesh removed from the broth) and in a clean piece of canvas
and press it well. Then take it and slice into thin slices, and not too
(thick). Take onions, vinegar and parsley and lay thereon. Serve.</b>

<p><b>My Redaction:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>4 veal shanks, cleaned</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 calf's feet, split</b></li>

<li>
<b>Water to cover</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cp honey</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 cp onion, finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 cp fresh parsley, finely chopped</b></li>

<li>
<b>Wine Vinegar</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Wash meat and place in a large kettle. Cover with water. Add honey.
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a slow boil. Cover. Cook for 2 1/2 to 3
hrs. or until meat falls apart. Remove meat from liquid. Remove bones from
meat when cool enough to handle, chopping large pieces smaller, including
skin if any. Put meat on a clean sterilized white cloth (canvas is best
but muslin works fine). Wrap into a large sausage shaped roll. Place on
a large pan or baking dish. Set a pan the same size on top and place a
weight on it. (A one gallon jug of water works well, or 4 bricks). Refrigerate
for several hours or overnight. Remove cloth. Place on an oblong serving
platter. Slice thinly. Sprinkle with onions, parsley and wine vingar. Serve.</b>
<p><b>Note: A line of thinly sliced onion rings down the center and parsley
springs around the outside makes a nice garnish. The broth remaining can
be strained and reduced to half, refrigerated and then unmolded to serve
as an accompanying aspic.</b>
<p><b>General Comments:</b>
<p><b>Since the recipe is from <i>Curye on Inglysch</i>, smoked sturgeon
would make sense. The thin layer of fat surrounding the finished roll was
gray colored and retained the pattern of the cloth. It was also flattened,
resembling a fish fillet. When cut into it revealed a nice coppery color
that looked without too much of a stretch of the imagination like smoked
fish.</b>
<p><b>This dish is a nice looking dish and is really rather tasty. I am
of the opinion that the recipe for Mock Sturgeon which calls for boiling
in honey is exactly what was intended and the quest to explain the word
honey as a scribal error or otherwise is totally unnecessary. All and all,
this dish is good enough to serve at feast and definately will go in my
modern recipe collection as a thing to be served at special occasions or
dish to passes. IMHO, the search for corroborating evidence by looking
in similar recipes is an exercise in futility as there were many versions
of the same recipe. Such exercises may help in filling the missing parts
of obscure or missing texts but, as this recipe shows, it should never
become the first thing one does when trying to understand a recipe from
the Middle Ages. The first thing one should do is throw off the scholars
robe, roll up one's sleeves and "get thee hence to the kitchen"! :-)</b><b></b>
