<center><b>A spinach or chard pie - c<font color="#000000">ontributed by
Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipes from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>An Herb Pie for May. Cut up and pound as much cheese as I suggested
for the first and second pies [a pound and a half of the best fresh cheese].
To this, when it is pounded, add juice of chard, a little marjoram, a little
more sage, a bit of mint, and more parsley. When all this had been pounded
in a mortar, add fifteen or sixteen beaten egg whites and half a pound
of fat or fresh butter. Some also put in some leaves of parsley and marjoram,
cut but not pounded, a half pound of white ginger and eight ounces of sugar.
When all these are mixed together and put in a pot or well-greased pan,
make them boil on coals far from flame so they do not absorb smoke, mixing
constantly until they become thick. When they are almost cooked and transferred
to a dish, cover with the best sugar and rose water. This dish is as much
greener as it is better and more pleasing. Let Philenus Archigallus beware
of this, for it digests slowly, dulls the eyes, makes obstructions, and
generates stone. (Milham, 365)</b>
<p><b>On Spinach and Chard. Spinach is the lightest kind found among garden
vegetables. I would believe it is divided into two kinds, since there is
black and white. Black grows almost with a head like onions, cabbage, and
lettuce, and there is almost no garden vegetable greater in breadth. Some
think the nature of spinach inert and without force, even if it usually
disturbs the bowel even to the bile. Taken in food, it soothes excessive
menstruation in women, but chard, which is white, maintains a mean. It
is most usefully given to those with liver and spleen illnesses, with sweet
spices which temper its saltiness. it likewise relieves the heat of summer,
revives those who are disinterested in food because of squeamishness, and
fills nursing women with a lot of milk. Eaten with its own juice, it moves
the bowels, but eaten alone, with the juice thrown away, it constricts
them. (Milham , 319)</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>Platina suggests combining cheese that has been pounded with chard
juice, marjoram, sage, mint, and parsley, then pounding again to mix the
ingredients. After thorough mixing, beaten egg whites are added along with
half a pound of fat or butter. Platina then suggests that additional ingredients
could be added, among them parsley and marjoram which are freshly cut rather
than pounded like the herbs mixed with the cheese earlier in the recipe.
It is at this point that he also suggests that some cooks add half a pound
of white ginger and eight ounces of sugar. The half pound of ginger surely
must be a scribal error because all other recipes of this type clearly
state that a half ounce of ginger is used. Half a pound of ginger would
make the pie inedible. Half a pound of sugar would result in an incredibly
sweet but otherwise edible pie.</b>
<p><b>After all the ingredients are mixed together, Platina states that
everything should be placed in a well-greased pot, away from the smoke
of a fire, and stirred constantly while they are cooking so they become
thick. When everything is almost cooked, not that much unlike how scrambled
eggs are cooked today, the eggs are transferred to another dish, sprinkled
with rosewater and more sugar, and served.</b>
<p><b>Pie crusts:</b>
<p><b>The herb pie detailed in Platina's recipe never specifically states
that it is a pie with crust; however, most "torte" recipes in Book 8 include
at least one pastry crust rolled thin for the bottom of the pie. Some recipes
even suggest using a top crust. We have chosen to make this pie with a
bottom crust, similar to other pies in the same section of the manuscript,
despite the fact that none is called for in the recipe.</b>
<p><b>Cheese types:</b>
<p><b>We made this pie using something other than the modern equivalent
of Platina's <i>"best fresh cheese."</i> Today's equivalent of a good fresh
cheese would be not too dissimilar to cottage cheese, though quite a bit
drier. Modern cottage cheese is newly curded cheese with some of the cream
added back into the mix (hence the creamy sauce surrounding the curds).
Some scholars believe that "farmer's cheese" would be a good substitute
for the fresh cheese Platina requests. Unfortunately, throughout the United
States, the definition of farmer's cheese differs greatly, ranging from
a green (new) cheese to a liquid-like goo sold as a delicacy in areas where
the Amish are present. In South Eastern Michigan, farmer's cheese is typically
an amorphous blob of green cheese, cut into a slab, wrapped in plastic,
and sold in the expensive section of pricey grocery stores. Because of
availability, we could only use Monterey Jack cheese for the test feast.</b>
<p><b>Using spinach or chard:</b>
<p><b>Nowhere in Platina's recipe did the pie require the addition of spinach
for anything other than color from the juice. It was purely fabrication
in the mind of the head cook. The green was added to balance other portions
of the feast both mundanely and in a period manner. Because Platina listed
the spinach as <i>"inert"</i> in its effects among some thinkers of the
day, we chose to add it under the theory that it was a spring green that
needed to be used. Mundanely, for the vegetarian minded folks attending
the feast, we added the spinach to round out the dish itself and provide
better nutritional value.</b>
