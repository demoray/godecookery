<p><b>The original recipe this was based upon is from Robert May's <i>The
Accomplisht Cook,</i> 1660, as redacted by Madge Lorwin in <i>Dining with
William Shakespeare</i>, 1976. This is May's original:</b>

<p><b><i>To Make a Marchpane</i></b></center>

<p><b><i>Take two pound of almonds blanched and beaten in a stone mortar,
till they begin to come to a fine paste, then take a pound of sifted sugar
put it in the mortar with the almonds, and make it into a perfect paste,
putting to it now and then in the beating of it a spoonfull of rose-water
to keep it from oyling; when you have beaten it to a puff-paste, drive
it out as big as a charger, and set an edge about it as you do a quodling
tart, and the bottom of wafers under it, thus bake it in an oven or baking-pan;
when you see it white, and hard, and dry, take it out, and ice it with
rosewater and suger, being made as thick as butter for fritters, so spread
it on with a wing feather, and put it into the oven again; when you see
it rise high, then take it out and garnish it with come pretty conceits
made of the same stuff.</i></b>
<p><b>This is Lorwin's recipe as I followed it:&nbsp;</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>3/4 lb. almond paste</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 Tbs. rose water</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cup butter</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/3 cup sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 egg, separated</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/4 cups flour</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Cream butter and sugar together until light. Beat in the egg yolk, stir
in the flour, one-third at a time, then refrigerate the dough for fifteen
minutes. I formed a round cookie base for the plain marchpane and for the
High Table a square one, in 2 parts, the same size of the chessboard, whose
pieces we used to fashion the chess pieces for the conceit. I brushed the
cookie with egg white and baked it at 350&deg; F for 15 minutes. It was
kept frozen in this state until Friday of the event. We then mixed together
the almond paste and rose-water.</b>
<p><b>For the plain marchpane, The marzipan was rolled out atop sifted
powdered sugar with more on top and placed very carefully on the "cookie"
base. I baked it at 325&deg; F for 10 minutes. You have to keep a careful
watch on it as it can burn very easily.</b>
<p><b>For the High Table's marchpane, the cookie base was square and divided
in 2 halves for ease in transportation. The marzipan was mixed as before.
but divided into 2 parts, one colored red with food coloring, the other
left plain. Each of the 64 squares was rolled out individually and cut
using much sifted, powdered sugar. The squares were fitted together and
surrounded by a plain border before being baked. The decoration for the
marchpane was inspired by a quote in Lorwin's book, stating that Queen
Elizabeth received in 1562 a New Year's gift from her master cook, George
Webster, a <i>"faire marchpane being a chessboard."</i> It didn't say whether
or not it was three-dimensional or playable, but I decided to opt for both.
May states that a marchpane is to be decorated with <i>"pretty conceits
made of the same stuff,"</i> namely marzipan. But I wanted chess pieces
that could be played with. Baroness Francesca made the pieces out of sugar
paste. She was inspired by a recipe for gum paste in Sir Hugh Plat's <i>Delights
for Ladies, to Adorn Their Persons, Tables, Closets and Distillatories
with Beauties, Banquets, Perfumes and Waters</i>, London, 1609. It was
most recently published in <i>A Collection of Medieval and Rennaissance
Cookbooks</i>, Cariadoc of the Bow and Diana Alene eds. (copy apended).
In her own words:</b>
<p><b>"The recipe that I used is the Wilton mix for gum paste. I added
rose water to come closer to the flavor of Plat's gum paste. I know that
this recipe is not precisley the same as the period version, but I feel
that the consistency and the fact that they are edible are the same in
many ways. I used vegetable coloring in the red pieces. I felt that the
maroon color was the closest to a beet color. I took a chess set and used
the gum paste to create a mould by pressing the chess pieces into the paste,
thus creating a reverse mold of the pieces. The gum paste was dried and
then more gum paste was used to form the halves of the pieces by pressing
them into the molds. When dried, the halves were "glued" together with
royal icing. Royal Icing traditionally uses egg whites, sugar and water.
I used Wilton meringue powder to avoid problems with raw egg white."</b>
