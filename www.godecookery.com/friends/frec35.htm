<center><b>Grape leaves stuffed with rice - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Michael Hobbes</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipe from <i>Perry, p. 20:</i></b>
<p><b>Asidah. Water is taken and rice is put in until it swells. Then flour
is sprinkled on it and it is stirred until done. Then it is taken off and
fat and dibs are put with it. And if it is sprinkled with nuts, it is better.</b>
<p>
<hr SIZE=1 NOSHADE WIDTH="80%">
<p><b>Modern recipe:</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Grape Leaves (preserved in brine are best)</b></li>

<li>
<b>Rice</b></li>

<li>
<b>Salt</b></li>

<li>
<b>Mint</b></li>

<li>
<b>Butter</b></li>

<li>
<b>Olive Oil</b></li>

<li>
<b>Garlic</b></li>

<li>
<b>Pepper, crushed</b></li>

<li>
<b>Garbanzos, finely chopped&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Chop the mint and garlic finely and set aside. Boil the rice in salted
water until almost done. Add the mint, pepper, garbanzos, and garlic and
then complete cooking rice. Make certain not to overcook as the garbanzos
will be gluey. Drain. While still hot, mix in the margarine and stir thoroughly.
Next, thoroughly rinse the grape leaves and press to remove excess water
and salt. Place a heaping teaspoon of the rice mixture on a leaf and carefully
roll it. It should be rolled in such a way that it can be picked up with
one hand and not open. Place them in a shallow pan and cover with salt
water. Cook at 350&deg; F until the leaf is completely done and the brine
has added flavor to the rice. Just before serving, brush with olive oil.
Serve hot. It is better to use preserved grape leaves as the fresh ones
sometimes have a bitterness that is removed during the pickling process.</b>
