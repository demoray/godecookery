<center><b>An elderflower &amp; ricotta cheese pie - c<font color="#000000">ontributed
by Gaylin J. Walli</font></b></center>

<p><b>Original recipes from <i>De honesta voluptate:</i></b>
<p><b>Elderberry Pie. Mix with elder flowers all the things which we have
noted for white pie. The latter mixture ought to be, however, thicker than
the former, because the flowers are distributed throughout. Although this
dish is of little nourishment and is digested slowly, nevertheless it makes
those eating it frequently happier. Let Caelius eat this, who surpasses
Saturn in melancholy. (Milham, 367)</b>
<p><b>White Pie. Pound well a pound and a half of the best fresh cheese,
cut up especially fine. When it is pounded, mix in twelve to fifteen egg
whites, a half pound of sugar, a half ounce of white ginger, a half pound
of pork fat, the same of fresh butter, and as much milk as will be enough.
When you have spread a thin pastry crust in an earthenware pot, put in
all these things. When it has been placed on the hearth, cook on a slow
fire. Put coals on the top of the lid so that it will become more colored.
When it is cooked and taken from this pot, sprinkle ground sugar with rose
water on it. This is very nourishing, is digested slowly, warms the liver,
but it causes blockages, generates stone, and is bad for eyes and nerves.
(Milham, 363)</b>

<p><b>Modern recipe: Elder Flower White Pie</b>
<p><b>For 160</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>20 deep-dish pie crusts, pre-baked</b></li>

<li>
<b>20 pounds fresh ricotta cheese</b></li>

<li>
<b>160 egg whites, very lightly beaten</b></li>

<li>
<b>3 1/3 quarts sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>6 2/3 ounces fresh ginger root, peeled and minced fine</b></li>

<li>
<b>5 pounds lard</b></li>

<li>
<b>5 pounds butter</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 1/2 quart milk (or less)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 1/4 cups elder flowers dried</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 cup granulated sugar, for sprinkling</b></li>

<li>
<b>rosewater, for sprinkling: OPTIONAL</b></li>
</ul>
<b>For 8</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 deep-dish pie crust, pre-baked</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 pound fresh ricotta cheese&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>8 egg whites, very lightly beaten&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>2/3 cup sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/3 ounce fresh ginger root, peeled and minced fine</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 pound lard</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/4 pound butter</b></li>

<li>
<b>1/2 cup milk (or less)</b></li>

<li>
<b>1 tablespoon elder flowers dried&nbsp;</b></li>

<li>
<b>2 teaspoons granulated sugar, for sprinkling</b></li>

<li>
<b>rosewater, for sprinkling: OPTIONAL</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Preheat your oven to 325&deg;F. Soften the butter and the lard together,
preferably at room temperature (do not melt). Place the cheese in a mixing
bowl and add the softened butter and lard, mixing well. Add the ginger
and mix well. Add the egg whites, mixing as little as possible and only
until thoroughly combined. Add the sugar and mix well. Add the milk, checking
to see that the consistency does not get soupy. Use less milk to maintain
a batter-like appearance. Add the flowers last and mix until just combined.</b>
<p><b>Add the mixture to a pre-baked pie shell and bake for 40 minutes.
When the oil from the pie separates on the top, remove it from the oven
and sprinkle it with the extra sugar and optionally with a few drops of
rosewater. Place the pie briefly under the broiler and brown the sugar
on the top lightly (or use a kitchen torch to brown the top and caramelize
the sugar slightly). Cool the pies to room temperature before cutting.
The pie will set as it cools.</b>

<p><b>Notes on the recipe:</b>
<p><b>This recipe represents a somewhat fattier version of today's traditional
baked cheesecakes. There's a good chance this recipe would be made similarly
to today's ricotta-based cakes (sometimes called "Italian cheesecakes"),
which, along with their creamed-cheese counterparts, are really more rich
and dense custards than flour-based "cakes" as we might think of today.</b>
<p><b>The instructions Platina gives us are fairly straightforward. Take
your cheese and make sure it's creamy (this is the pounding), add to it
some egg whites, sugar, ginger, pork fat, butter, and milk and mix all
ingredients well. In an alternate version of the pie, elder flowers (not
elder berries as the recipe title suggests) are also added. Everything
is put in a pastry crust, baked, lightly browned on top, and finally sprinkled
with sugar and rose water prior to serving.</b>
<p><b>It is possible that when Platina states <i>"the latter mixture ought
to be thicker than the former"</i> is because the elder flowers require
an evenly distributed suspension. Contrary to some researchers' opinions,
we do not believe Platina is informing the cook that the mixture's addition
of elder flowers will result in a thicker product. Our experience does
not indicate this actually happens.</b>
<p><b>Egg preparation:</b>
<p><b>Although whipping the egg whites is not a specified step in any part
of this recipe, some cooks may wish to whip them to soft, white peaks and
fold them into the cheese mixture to lighten the texture of the pie. We
found the texture of the pies to be suitable without this step.</b>
<p><b>Fresh vs. dry ginger:</b>
<p><b>The fresh ginger gives this recipe an added<i> je ne sais quoi</i>
that simply can't be imitated by the powdered spice. Do not try to substitute
the dried powder for the freshly minced root as the powder will make the
dish slightly bitter. If you can't find the fresh root in the vegetable
section of a grocery store, try looking in the ethnic food section near
the Asian offerings. Preserved, unsweetened, and pre-minced ginger often
comes in jars, though its cost is usually prohibitive.</b>
