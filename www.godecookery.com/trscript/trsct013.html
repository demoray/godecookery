<ul>
<li>
<b>Chicken meat (see note, below), finely minced</b></li>

<li>
<b>Milk</b></li>

<li>
<b>Cream</b></li>

<li>
<b>Rice flour</b></li>

<li>
<b>Sugar</b></li>

<li>
<b>Rosewater</b></li>
</ul>
<b>Combine and beat well together the milk, cream, &amp; rice flour into
a batter-like consistency. Place in a saucepan and add the minced meat;
slowly bring to a low boil, stirring to prevent sticking. Beat in the sugar
&amp; rosewater and bring back to a low boil. Contine to cook, stirring
frequently, until the mixture becomes very thick. Remove from heat and
pour the mixture into a rectangle or square pan. Allow to cool, then place
in a refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Slice the blancmange
into portions &amp; serve.</b>
<p><b>Brawn is usaually the dark meat of either capon or pork; in this
receipt it is brawn of capon that is being used. However, in some medieval
recipes, brawn is intended to be the white breast meat of the bird, which
may be the case here. (See Constance B. Hieatt's notes on brawn in <i>Curye
on Inglisch</i>.) <i>Bleaw manger</i> means <i>white food</i>, and while
the brawn of capon is perfectly suitable here (and is what is called for
in other medieval blancmange recipes), the breast meat would be far more
appropriate for a dish meant to be white.</b>
