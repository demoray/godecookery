<b>Carefully cut your lamb into long thin strips, about 6-8 inches long,
2 inches wide, and 1/8 inch thick. Blend together all the stuffing ingredients
into a malleable mixture, then spread a spoonful of stuffing onto each
strip of lamb. Roll the strip from one end to the other, placing each roll
into the pie shell, continuing until the pie is full. Sprinkle on sugar,
cinnamon, saffron, &amp; a little salt, then cover with some chopped hard
boiled egg yolks, chopped dates, &amp; raisins. Cover with a pastry lid.
In the center of the lid, cut a cross into the pastry. Peel the pastry
back from the center points to make an opening in the middle of the pie,
about 2 inches in diameter. Bake until the pastry is golden brown &amp;
the inside fully cooked.</b>
<p><b>Bring the claret to a low boil, and beat in a small amount of toasted
bread crumb to slightly thicken it. Add the cinnamon &amp; ginger and sweeten
with sugar.</b>
<p><b>When the pie is removed from the oven, pour the sauce into the pie
through the opening in the lid. Serve.</b>
<p><b>Aloes were small, stuffed meat rolls, usually prepared by roasting
on a broach or spit. While being cooked they are similar in appearance
to small birds, sans head &amp; feet, being spit roasted, thus the name
<i>aloes</i>,
which was Old French for <i>larks</i>. This receipt is a unique variation
of the usual medieval version in that the aloes are not spit roasted but
made into a pie.</b>
