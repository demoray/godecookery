speaking, the word "venison" in the Middle Ages was in reference to any
beast of the hunt, not just deer, and could imply a variety of
creatures
we would never normally associate with "venison." And for deer itself,
more specific identifications such as stag, roe, buck, etc., were in
more
common use than today, indicating a much closer relationship with the
animal.
Medieval people had a great fondness for deer, and venison of deer was
an enormously popular food, as the records of great households tell us.
For example, the 13th c. Bishop Richard de Swinfield frequently ate it,
and not only during great feasts. In Christmas of 1289 he and his
household
consumed four does as mere appetizers between courses, and on Ascension
Day 1290 they had two sides and one haunch of hart, one side of doe,
one
fresh deer and two roe deer. For Easter 1290 they ate three deer. For
this
particular household, deer venison represented half the meat eaten at
Ascension,
a quarter eaten at Christmas, and one-fifth of the meat consumed at
Easter.</b></div>

Swinfield was surely not bored with a steady diet of deer meat, as
medieval
cooks prepared their venison in a variety of delicious ways. It was
roasted,
boiled, baked, and cooked on a spit. It was served in huge broiled
chunks,
it was hacked into pieces and covered with strange sauces, and it was
mixed
with eggs and fruit and baked in meat pies. It was made into <i>"nombles,"</i>
served with <i>"furmenty,"</i> cut into <i>"ffelettes,"</i> and
turned
into <i>"carpeis."</i> There were venison soups, venison rice dishes,
and
even "mock" venison: the genitals and intestines were highly esteemed
as
trophies of the hunt and were served, hot and steaming, in honor to the
high table as a dish called <i>"haslett"</i> (thus making the deer a
versatile
beast, indeed). In later periods more "civilized" folk substituted the
real thing with sliced apples &amp; pears, dried fruits, and nuts, all
strung together and batter fried. The resulting product was quite
realistic
in appearance (and very delicious). When cooking real venison, such as
ribs, the recipe was often a simple one:<i> "Venison in broth: take
ribs
of venison, and wash him fair in water. And strain the water through a
strainer into a fair pot, and cast the venison thereto (with) parsley,
sage, pepper, cloves, mace, vinegar, (and) salt. And let it boil til it
be done, and serve it forth."</i> For a roast venison, one should <i>"take
fair filets of venison, and pick away the skin and the bone, and
parboil
it, and roast it on a spit. And sauce thereto. And serve it forth."</i>
The most popular sauce accompanying venison was frumenty, made from
wheat
boiled with milk and eggs and flavored with saffron and sugar. Equally
good was a pepper sauce, made by frying bread in oil, then blending the
bread thoroughly with broth and vinegar to make a thickened sauce, and
seasoning with salt and freshly ground pepper.</b></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b>As the centuries have
passed, so has our taste for venison. Beef, pork,
and poultry have become the meats of choice and venison is now
considered
a bit of an oddity. Venison is certainly more common than buffalo or
crocodile
meat, but still very hard to find, in the United States, without being
a hunter or knowing one. (The fortunate English are still able to
purchase
it in butcher shops &amp; restaurants.) Oh, the lucky feast cook who
can
lay venison before his guests! I was fortunate enough once to be given
a whole deer, freshly killed and dressed, just one day before a
medieval
feast I was cooking for. The deer was expertly spit-roasted all day
long
by a local hunter, and brought into the hall, still on the spit, on the
shoulders of two young men. When served it literally melted in your
mouth.
It was an occasion that will live long in my memory. So now when I
drive
down the road and see the ubiquitous signs of a highway deer fatality,
I'm reminded of the history of this fine beast and tell myself, "Now
there's
some tasty looking nombles!"</b></div>
